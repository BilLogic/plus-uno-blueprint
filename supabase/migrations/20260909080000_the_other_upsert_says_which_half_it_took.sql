-- The other upsert says which half it took, and its undo stops guessing.
--
-- `upsert_cell` upserts. Landing on a square of the grid that already holds a
-- cell it UPDATES that row and hands back its id — the same id, in the same
-- shape, as the one it returns when it inserts. Nothing downstream can tell
-- the two apart, and one thing downstream has to: the ledger derives this
-- write's inverse from the operation's NAME, and the name says "cell", so the
-- inverse it records is `delete_cell`.
--
-- On the insert half that is exact. On the update half it is destruction
-- dressed as an undo: the cell was there before the write, the write only
-- changed its text, and taking the write back removes the cell entirely —
-- with its summary, its Function, its Form, its Value props, its owner pair
-- and its status, none of which this write touched.
--
-- ── WHY THIS IS NOT A LIVE DEFECT, AND WHY THAT IS THE ARGUMENT ───────────
--
-- Both callers establish the slot was empty before they call. The panel calls
-- `upsert_cell` only on a draft, when there is no cell id to update; the agent
-- tool reads the slot first and refuses with "A cell already exists at that
-- slot … `upsert_cell` only creates."
--
-- So nothing reaches the update half today, and this file is not a repair of
-- a symptom anybody has seen. It is a repair of the reason nobody has seen
-- one, which is two callers remembering.
--
-- The agent tool's occupancy check is a read followed by a write. Between the
-- read and the upsert nothing holds the slot: two agent turns on the same
-- board, or an agent and a person, and both reads see an empty square and the
-- second write lands on the first write's cell. The window is small and the
-- consequence is not — the loser's undo deletes the winner's cell.
--
-- And the guard is per-caller. It defends the two callers that carry it and
-- must be carried again by the third, which is a rule living in prose in two
-- files rather than in the operation. `20260909070000` made this exact
-- argument for `set_cell_dependency` and pointed at THIS function's guard as
-- the cheaper fix it declined to copy. This file finishes that sentence.
--
-- The guards STAY. Once the write reports for itself they are belt-and-braces
-- rather than the safety, and the agent tool's refusal is a better answer to
-- "create a cell where one already is" than a silent update would be. What
-- changes is that the ledger no longer depends on them being remembered.
--
-- ── WHAT THE FUNCTION NOW RETURNS ─────────────────────────────────────────
--
--     { "id": uuid, "inserted": boolean, "previous": {…} | null }
--
--   id         the row written, either half. What every existing caller read
--              off the old `uuid` return, now under a name.
--   inserted   which half the upsert took, read from the written row's `xmax`
--              — zero exactly when this statement inserted it. No caller can
--              establish this afterwards, which is why the write says it.
--   previous   the row AS IT STOOD, captured before the write under a lock,
--              or null when there was nothing there. Keyed on the row's own
--              id, so the undo restores THIS cell and not whatever occupies
--              the square by the time it runs.
--
-- `previous` is null whenever `inserted` is true, and it can ALSO be null when
-- `inserted` is false: another session inserting the cell between the capture
-- and the upsert leaves this call updating a row it never saw. That is a state
-- the caller must be able to see, because the honest answer to it is to offer
-- no undo at all rather than an approximate one — which is what the ledger
-- already does with the deletes.
--
-- ── WHAT `previous` CARRIES, AND WHY IT IS ONE COLUMN ─────────────────────
--
-- A cell has nineteen columns and this carries one of them, which wants
-- saying out loud rather than discovering.
--
-- The update half writes exactly one: `do update set content =
-- excluded.content`. Everything else in the `values` list is either part of
-- the conflict key (path, lane, step, slot) or set only on the insert —
-- `origin`, and `cell_key`, which is deliberately minted on insert and never
-- on update because a cell's key is its identity for slice recovery.
--
-- So `previous` carries `id` and `content`, and the restore writes `content`.
-- That is everything `upsert_cell` can change, which is the whole of what its
-- undo may change.
--
-- The temptation is the rest of `CELL_FIELDS` in `scripts/authored_fields.mjs`
-- — the list of what a person actually types into a cell, which is `content`
-- plus summary, status, function, form, value_props, owner and
-- perceived_owner. Seven of those eight are not this function's to write. An
-- undo that put them back too would look more thorough and would be wrong:
-- `upsert_cell` never wrote them, so restoring them would reach past this
-- write and revert somebody's separate edit, which has its own ledger row and
-- its own inverse through `update_cell_content` and `update_cell_spec`. An
-- inverse that undoes more than its operation did is the same class of error
-- as one that undoes less.
--
-- ── WHY THE RETURN TYPE MOVES, AND WHAT THAT COSTS ────────────────────────
--
-- A `uuid` cannot carry two more facts, and Postgres will not let `create or
-- replace` change a return type. So the function is dropped and recreated,
-- which takes its ACL with it. On this platform a freshly created function
-- picks up the default privileges, which include `anon`, and `revoke … from
-- public` does not take away a role's own grant — which is how two RPCs on
-- this deployment ended up granting EXECUTE to the anonymous reader. So the
-- ACL below is restated in full rather than assumed, and it was checked
-- against `delete_cell`'s in the catalogue rather than against a memory of
-- what it should be: `postgres`, `authenticated`, `service_role`, and nothing
-- else.
--
-- The signature is byte-identical, so every caller's ARGUMENTS are unaffected
-- — over PostgREST too, which resolves by argument name. What changes is what
-- comes back, and the two readers of that are the panel's editor, which takes
-- the id, and the agent tool, which quotes it.
--
-- ── THE OTHER HALF: A CELL'S TEXT CAN BE PUT BACK ─────────────────────────
--
-- Knowing the upsert updated is only half an undo; the other half needs an
-- operation that restores what the update overwrote. `restore_cell_content`
-- is that operation and nothing else — one prose column, on one row, by id.
-- It exists for the same reason `restore_cell_dependency`, `restore_placement`
-- and `restore_featured_resources` do: an inverse a caller cannot express with
-- the forward operation needs a function of its own.
--
-- It is not `update_cell_content` wearing another name, and the difference is
-- the job. That one is a direct table write under the caller's own privileges,
-- reached by the panel, carrying summary and status and the owner pair
-- alongside the text. This is an UNDO of a different operation: one column,
-- addressed by id, on a row that is already where it was.
--
-- It ASSIGNS rather than coalescing. `cells.content` is `not null default ''`,
-- so the state a coalescing inverse could not express is not null but EMPTY:
-- the panel creates a cell from a draft with `form.content.trim()`, which is
-- routinely the empty string, and an agent writing text onto that blank square
-- is exactly the collision this file is about. An inverse that treated `''` as
-- "the caller said nothing" would leave the agent's sentence standing and
-- report success. A revert control that silently cannot clear a field is worse
-- than no revert control, because it lies.
--
-- And it does not trim. `upsert_cell` does not trim either — it coalesces and
-- writes what it is given — so a value that reaches this function has already
-- been trimmed by whatever wrote it, except an imported row, which the
-- pipeline writes directly. A restore that trimmed would quietly rewrite such
-- a row on the way back rather than putting it back.
--
-- A zero-row update is a failure and says so. There is no state in which the
-- undo of an edit to a row that still exists matches nothing, so matching
-- nothing means the cell is gone and the caller is owed the sentence.
--
-- One thing the restore does NOT undo, said plainly: `upsert_cell` links the
-- step to the path first when the link is missing, and neither the delete this
-- replaces nor the restore that succeeds it removes that link. That is
-- unchanged by this file, and on the update half it is unreachable anyway — a
-- cell cannot exist in a column the path does not carry.

-- ── THE BEHAVIOUR, PERFORMED ──────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Six claims, none of them readable off the definitions above:
--
--   1. the first call INSERTS and says so, and offers no previous — the half
--      whose inverse has always been a delete, and still is;
--   2. the second call on the same square UPDATES and says so, on the same
--      row — the half whose inverse was a delete and is now a restore;
--   3. the previous it hands back is the row BEFORE this write, not after:
--      checked on a call that overwrites the text, where a function returning
--      the row as it now stands would agree with the row and only disagree
--      here;
--   4. the undo, performed. Feeding that previous back through
--      `restore_cell_content` puts the text back, INCLUDING back to the empty
--      string — the case an inverse that coalesced could not express, and the
--      case a blank cell an agent writes onto actually is;
--   5. the undo carries one column and no more: a summary typed between the
--      two writes is still there afterwards. That is the deliberate scope of
--      `previous`, and the assertion is what keeps it deliberate;
--   6. a restore of a row that is gone says so rather than passing quietly.
--
-- And the cell is counted throughout, because the defect this file closes is
-- a cell that stops existing: one row before the undo, one row after.
--
-- Run under `set local role authenticated` with a service-account JWT, not as
-- the owner. An owner run proves nothing about the grants above, and the
-- restrictive service-account policies on this table match ZERO ROWS SILENTLY
-- under a plain authenticated session — a proof that cannot tell "refused"
-- from "matched nothing" is a proof of nothing. The fixture is built as owner,
-- because building it is not what is being proved.
--
-- The whole block rolls itself back through the sentinel exception, in the
-- shape `20260830180000` established: a migration may prove a thing, and may
-- not leave the rows it proved it with. Nothing here touches a row it did not
-- create.
