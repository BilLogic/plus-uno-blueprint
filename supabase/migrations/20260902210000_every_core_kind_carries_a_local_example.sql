-- Every core kind carries a local example.
--
-- A definition tooltip teaches the generic concept — what a phase is, what a
-- lane is — but it cannot ground that concept in the reader's own service
-- without one of two bad outcomes: bake one deployment's content in as
-- everyone's, or show nothing concrete and leave the abstraction abstract
-- (#302). The fix is an authored, free-text example for each of the six core
-- kinds — service, phase, scenario, path, step, lane — written once, per
-- deployment, and shown under the definition as its own section.
--
-- ── Why a column on `services`, and why jsonb ────────────────────────────
--
-- The set is small, fixed, per-service and never queried on its own, so it is
-- a single jsonb object on the service row rather than a child table — the
-- storage decision #302 records. It rides the service block of the blueprint
-- source: the mapping skill authors it, the seed generator emits it, and a
-- re-map round-trips it, which is why this is blueprint DATA on `services` and
-- not app config in a file a re-map would wipe.
--
-- The six keys are a fixed vocabulary the app owns, so there is deliberately
-- NO CHECK here. A constraint enumerating the keys would be a second place the
-- kind list lives — the residue the 2026-08-30 vocabulary work spent a month
-- removing — and it would reject a forward-compatible seventh key on the day
-- the app learned to write one. The column stays a plain jsonb object; the
-- shape is enforced where it is read.
--
-- Additive and non-breaking: default `{}` so the row that exists today, and
-- every deployment that has authored nothing yet, reads back an empty map and
-- renders no example. It applies to prod before the read that consumes it
-- merges.
--
-- ── Replaying against an empty database ──────────────────────────────────
--
-- One additive column with a default. The proof is an INVARIANT, never a
-- census: after the add every row has a non-null object default, which is
-- vacuously true on an empty replay and is the evidence on production that the
-- default took and no reader meets a null map.

  'Per-service authored examples, one free-text value per core kind (service, phase, scenario, path, step, lane), shown under each kind''s definition to ground it in this deployment. Blueprint data, not app config: it rides the service block so a re-map round-trips it. A jsonb object with no CHECK — the six-key shape is the app''s, and an unwritten key simply does not render.';
