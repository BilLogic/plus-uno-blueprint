-- 20260830200000 — every authoring write leaves a record, not only the deletes.
--
-- CLOSE THE TAB AND THE RECORD OF WHAT CHANGED IS GONE.
--
-- Two recorders exist today and each covers half the story.
--
--   * DELETES are durable. Six `security definer` functions — delete_scenario,
--     delete_path, remove_step, remove_lane, remove_lanes, delete_cell — write
--     every row they are about to destroy into `public.deleted_structure` in
--     the same transaction as the cascade, and return that row's id.
--   * EVERY OTHER AUTHORING WRITE — renames, reorders, cell text, lane specs,
--     evidence, slices, findings, stakeholders — is recorded only in
--     `src/lib/authoringSession.ts`, a module-level JavaScript array. A page
--     refresh empties it.
--
-- So an agent that makes thirty edits and a human who makes thirty edits both
-- leave exactly nothing behind once the tab closes, while a single deleted
-- cell is remembered forever. That asymmetry is not a policy anyone chose; it
-- is what happens when the durable recorder is written as delete-safety rather
-- than as a record of authorship.
--
-- ONE LOG. `public.authoring_changes` records every authoring write. A delete
-- carries the rows it destroyed as its `payload`, exactly as the archive did,
-- so restore still has everything it ever had. `public.trash` is a VIEW over
-- the rows that carry a `deleted_kind`, so the recovery list is a filter on
-- one table rather than a second table that has to be kept in step with it.
-- `deleted_structure` is folded in and dropped rather than renamed: renaming
-- it would leave a table whose name says "deletions" holding renames.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHO WRITES A ROW, AND WHY THERE ARE TWO WRITERS RATHER THAN ONE
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- The app appends through `record_authoring_change`, a definer RPC that takes
-- the operation, its arguments, its captured inverse and the author. It takes
-- NO payload and no `deleted_kind` — a client cannot forge a trash entry, and
-- cannot claim to have archived rows it never had.
--
-- The six delete functions append their own row, because the payload has to be
-- captured inside the same transaction as the cascade that destroys it. A
-- client-side append could only ever run afterwards, by which time the rows it
-- was supposed to preserve are gone. So the sweep below rewrites those six
-- bodies to insert into `authoring_changes` instead, naming themselves in the
-- `fn` column, and the client skips its own append for exactly those six
-- operations (`ARCHIVED_BY_THE_DATABASE` in `src/lib/authoringLog.ts`). One
-- write, one row, from whichever side is holding the rows.
--
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- IT IS AUDIT-ONLY. The in-memory stack stays exactly as it is and remains the
-- fast undo affordance; `revert` is stored so a row can SAY what would undo it,
-- not so anything replays it. Replaying an inverse against a database that has
-- moved on is a different problem — the row it names may have been deleted,
-- renamed or reparented since — and #172 puts it out of scope on purpose.
--
-- IT DOES NOT RECORD A REVERT AS A CHANGE OF ITS OWN. `executeRevert` passes
-- `record: false` so that undoing "Added a lane" does not append "Deleted a
-- lane" to the very list the row was just removed from, and that argument is
-- unchanged here. The consequence is stated rather than hidden: a revert whose
-- inverse is a delete DOES leave a row, because the delete function writes it
-- server-side; a revert whose inverse is an update leaves none. Making the two
-- agree means separating "not in the undo list" from "not in the log" at every
-- one of the twelve mutation modules that thread `record: false`, which is a
-- change to the undo contract and not to this one.
--
-- IT MISATTRIBUTES ONE CASE, AND SAYS SO. A row written server-side carries
-- `author = 'human'`, because the delete functions have no way to see the
-- client's agent attribution. That is right for every delete the app can make
-- — the agent holds no delete tool at all (`WRITE_TOOL_NAMES` in
-- `src/lib/agent/tools/specs.ts` has none) — and wrong for exactly one path:
-- the agent's `undo_last_change` reverting its own `create_lane`, which fires
-- `remove_lanes` and archives it as a human's delete. Fixing it means passing
-- attribution into six function signatures, which is a wider change than the
-- one defect justifies. It is recorded here so the next reader finds it
-- written down rather than by disbelieving a row.
--
-- NO ROW COUNT IS ASSERTED ANYWHERE BELOW. Every assertion in this file is an
-- invariant that is vacuously true on an empty database and meaningful on the
-- populated one — `docs/reference/migration-replay-baseline.json` is a ratchet
-- and a migration that asserts "36 rows moved" fails every empty replay for
-- the rest of time. The one count that IS compared is compared to itself:
-- every archived deletion found is an archived deletion carried forward, which
-- is 0 = 0 on an empty database and 36 = 36 on production.

-- The six delete functions, redirected.
--
-- A `pg_get_functiondef` sweep rather than six rewritten bodies, for the
-- reason this series has learned five times: the file is not the apply path.
-- These bodies say `layers` and `service_scenarios` in the repository and
-- `lanes` and `scenarios` on production, because the renames that moved them
-- were themselves sweeps. Reproducing the bodies here would pick one of those
-- two schemas and break the other. Rewriting the text that is actually
-- installed picks neither.
--
-- The insert is textually identical in all six, which is what makes this
-- safe to do by replacement:
--
--   insert into public.deleted_structure (kind, label, payload, affected_slices)
--   values ('<kind>', …)
--
-- becomes
--
--   insert into public.authoring_changes (fn, deleted_kind, label, payload, affected_slices)
--   values ('<function name>', '<kind>', …)
--
-- so each function names itself in the `fn` column. `create or replace` with
-- the definition Postgres itself printed keeps the argument types, and
-- therefore keeps the ACL — see the drift assertion at the end of
-- 20260826100000 for what happens when it does not.
--
-- The set is discovered, not listed. A seventh function that archives the
-- same way is swept too, and — because the sweep raises on a shape it does
-- not recognise — a function that references the archive some other way stops
-- the migration instead of being quietly left pointing at a dropped table.
