-- A cell's featured image is its frame.
--
-- Authored 2026-09-13.
--
-- The template made a cell's featured image its frame in
-- `21000227000000_a_featured_image_is_the_frame.sql`, and the application code
-- that relies on it arrives here through the version pin. The schema does not:
-- this deployment is a separate Postgres with its own series. So the same
-- change is made again here, against this database.
--
-- The FEATURED IMAGE of a cell is `cells.frame`: whatever a person chose — a
-- storyboard illustration, a screenshot, one of the cell's attachments, or its
-- touchpoint's logo. What is stored is what shows. Links keep
-- `resources.featured`, which is the panel's buttons and a different thing.
--
-- ── WHY A FUNCTION AND NOT A COLUMN GRANT ────────────────────────────────
--
-- `authenticated` holds no UPDATE on `frame`, and no function wrote it. Every
-- other author write is a logged, undoable operation, so this one is too:
-- `set_cell_featured_image` returns the frame AS IT STOOD, and its inverse is
-- the same function pointed at that value.
--
-- ── THE ONE DEPARTURE: A FRAME IS AN ADDRESS HERE ────────────────────────
--
-- The function accepts an https address or a path on this site, exactly as
-- upstream wrote it. This database also holds `cells_frame_absolute`, which
-- refuses any frame starting with `/`, and it stays: the stock logos this
-- deployment shows live in the `cell-attachments` bucket, and each
-- touchpoint's `icon_url` points there (the data migration that follows this
-- file moves the six that still name `/touchpoint-logos/…`). So a path handed
-- to the function is refused by the constraint rather than by the function,
-- and the proof below uses an https logo where upstream's uses a path.
--
-- ── WHY PLACING A CELL FILLS AN EMPTY FRAME ──────────────────────────────
--
-- A cell placed on a touchpoint that carries a logo leads with that logo
-- until somebody chooses otherwise. `sync_cell_touchpoints` and
-- `set_placement_touchpoint` set `frame` to the entry's `icon_url` when the
-- frame is null or blank and the entry has one. A frame that holds anything is
-- never overwritten, and the sync fills only for placements it INSERTS, so a
-- text save does not refill a frame somebody cleared.
--
-- Both are rewritten from `pg_get_functiondef` — this database's own live
-- bodies, not the template's text — and each replacement is asserted to have
-- landed. Neither signature changes, and `create or replace` keeps both ACLs.
--
-- ── Replaying against an empty database ──────────────────────────────────
--
-- One new function, two rewrites, and a proof that builds its own fixture and
-- gives it back inside a sentinel-exception block.

-- The behaviour, performed

--
--   1. setting returns the frame as it stood, and feeding that back undoes it;
--   2. a logo address is accepted and clearing stores null, and a refused address and a missing cell each
--      fail with the sentence the panel shows;
--   3. an account that is not the service account cannot write;
--   4. the sync fills an empty frame with the logo of a touchpoint it places,
--      and leaves a set frame alone;
--   5. linking a placement to an entry with a logo does the same.
