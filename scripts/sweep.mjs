/**
 * ONE MODULE ANSWERS "GIVE ME THE FILES FOR THIS SUBJECT".
 *
 * Every check in this repository used to begin the same way and end
 * differently: resolve a root from its own location, walk a directory, decide
 * what a missing folder means, decide what a file that vanished between the
 * listing and the read means — and then, a hundred lines in, judge something.
 * Five helpers grew up around the first half (`app-source`, `swept-docs`,
 * `read-listed`, `repository-only`, `unverified`), each answering one piece
 * for the checks that knew to call it, and a check written without one of
 * them got that piece wrong in the way the helper's header described. They
 * are gone; this module is the first half, once — the skip-said-out-loud
 * rule that was `unverified.mjs` is the last section of this file. A check names a Subject, receives its
 * files, and contains only its judgement.
 *
 * A SUBJECT is a named tree and its rule: where its root is, which files are
 * its, and what "cannot see the subject" means there. There are eight — the
 * seven the plan named and the commit — and the answers differ in ways that
 * matter:
 *
 *   app              The application — a deployment's `src` laid over the
 *                    package's, per path (the Overlay; `overlay.mjs` is the
 *                    rule the build applies, and this is the same rule for a
 *                    walk). Paths read `src/…` wherever the file is. No
 *                    application anywhere is a FAILURE: a walk of nothing
 *                    passes every rule at once.
 *   docs             This repository's prose: every markdown file at the
 *                    root but the changelog, and the markdown under the
 *                    folders `repo-config.mjs` names — minus the dated
 *                    records, whose words are the day they were written. A
 *                    named folder this tree lacks is a SKIP SAID OUT LOUD: a
 *                    repository without a plugin surface has no `skills/`,
 *                    and that is a fact about the tree, announced once so a
 *                    misspelt name cannot pass as one.
 *   scripts          This repository's own executable code: `scripts/` and
 *                    the scripts under `skills/<skill>/scripts/`, which a model
 *                    runs against a live database. A deployment's scripts
 *                    are its own, so the root is always this tree's. No
 *                    scripts is a FAILURE.
 *   migrations       `supabase/migrations/`, the `.sql` files, this tree's. None is a
 *                    FAILURE.
 *   references       The published reference surface of THIS repository:
 *                    `references/` and every `skills/<skill>/references/`,
 *                    every file — the schemas are addressed by filename, so
 *                    they are as much the surface as the prose. A repository
 *                    without one is a SKIP SAID OUT LOUD, for the reason
 *                    `docs` gives.
 *   reference-docs   The PACKAGE's `references/`, read and never written —
 *                    what a check holds this tree's own documents against,
 *                    out of the installed package in a deployment and out of
 *                    this tree here. None is a FAILURE, and so is an installed
 *                    package that ships none: the deployment's own documents
 *                    are never handed back as the package's.
 *   deployment-seed  A deployment's seed, in a checkout beside this one.
 *                    Local only: exactly one sibling that ships a seed and is
 *                    not another checkout of this package. None, or several,
 *                    is a SKIP SAID OUT LOUD with the reason, because both
 *                    mean "nothing to run against".
 *   commit           Everything a commit of this tree would carry: the
 *                    tracked files and the untracked ones git would not
 *                    ignore, as `git ls-files` lists them. The eighth
 *                    subject, beyond the seven the plan named, because two
 *                    checks read the whole commit for a word or a value that
 *                    names nothing in particular, and "everything" is a
 *                    subject only git can list. A listing with nothing in it
 *                    is a FAILURE.
 *
 * WHAT COMES BACK is the same shape for every subject: the files as a
 * finding prints them (repo-relative, forward slashes, sorted), the base
 * those paths hang off, `locate(path)` for the one file a check names by
 * hand, and `read(path)`, which returns null for a file that vanished between
 * the listing and the read and throws for every other failure — the rule
 * `read-listed.mjs` held, stated here so no check states it again. `where`
 * narrows `files` and nothing else: `locate` and `read` answer for any path
 * under the subject, so a check can walk a corner of the application and still
 * read the one file it names by hand. `seen` says whether the subject was
 * there; when it was not and the subject skips, the skip has already been
 * said and `files` holds what could still be swept — nothing for
 * `references` and `deployment-seed`, the root documents for `docs`, whose
 * folders are each a fact of their own.
 *
 * A SWEEP THAT FINDS NOTHING THROWS, whatever the subject, once the `where`
 * filter has run: an empty subject and a clean one print the same green line,
 * and the green one goes on being printed every run after. The refusal names
 * the subject and the root it swept so the message is the one a reader needs.
 * A subject that skips is the exception, and says so first.

/**
 * A CHECK THAT COULD NOT LOOK AT ITS SUBJECT SAYS SO, WHERE A PERSON SEES IT.
 *
 * Every guard here ends in one of two states, and the two are printed the same
 * way. It looked and found nothing wrong; or it COULD NOT LOOK — the database
 * was not configured, the folder it sweeps is not in this tree, the checkout
 * was handed no tags — and it exited 0 with a friendly sentence in a log
 * nobody opens. The second is the whole defect class this module exists for: a
 * green job that has stopped measuring anything goes on reporting success, and
 * the run that would have caught the defect is indistinguishable from the run
 * before it.
 *
 * THE FIX IS NOT TO FAIL. Several of these skips are correct. A repository
 * without a plugin surface has no folder to sweep; a pull request has no live
 * target to ask. What is wrong with them is that they are INVISIBLE. So a skip
 * goes through here, and lands in the two places a person actually looks:
 *
 *   - an annotation on stderr, which a workflow runner surfaces against the
 *     step rather than leaving it a thousand lines down inside the log;
 *   - a line in the run's summary, so a finished job carries a list of what it
 *     did not verify beside the list of what it did.
 *
 * IT IS NOT AN ERROR AND IT IS NOT A LOG LINE. An error would fail the correct
 * skips, and a guard whose readers have learned to ignore it is worse than no
 * guard. A log line is what these already were. A warning is the one register
 * that says "this passed, and here is the part of it that measured nothing".
 *
 * WHAT A CALLER SAYS. Two things, in the caller's own words: WHAT went
 * unverified — the subject, never the script — and WHY it could not be
 * reached, including what an owner would set or run to reach it. A warning
 * that names a script tells a reader where to look; one that names the subject
 * tells them what they now do not know.
 *
 * SAID ONCE PER RUN. A library reached from three checks would otherwise
 * annotate three times for one fact, and a reader counting annotations would
 * be counting call sites instead of subjects. The first statement of a fact is
 * kept and the rest are dropped.
