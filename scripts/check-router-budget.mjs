/**
 * The always-loaded tier stays under a stated char budget, and the budget falls.
 *
 * A tier that bloats defeats the tier. `AGENTS.md` is handed to every session
 * before it decides anything, so every character in it is paid for by every
 * task, including the ones the character has nothing to do with — and a router
 * nobody finishes reading routes nobody. Who is in the tier, and why
 * `CONTEXT.md` and `INDEX.md` are not, is `scripts/always-loaded.mjs`.
 *
 * WHAT IS COUNTED: characters of the files in `ALWAYS_LOADED`, whole, as they
 * sit on disk. No frontmatter stripping — these files have none — and no
 * tokenisation, because a char count is the number an author can check against
 * their own editor. The report names every file it counted and its size, so a
 * total is never printed without the census behind it.
 *
 * TWO DIRECTIONS, ONE CONSTANT. `BUDGET` is a ceiling: over it, the check
 * fails. It is also a RATCHET: fall more than `SLACK` below it and the check
 * fails too, asking for the budget to be lowered. A ceiling that only ever
 * blocks is a ceiling that stops describing the file — the router shrank from
 * 6,642 chars to its present size in #366, and a 20,000-char budget written
 * before that cut would have gone on passing while meaning nothing. The
 * downward failure is the cheapest possible fix, a one-line edit here, and it
 * is what makes the number a promise rather than a decoration.
 *
 * `SLACK` is wide on purpose. A pointer added or a trigger reworded moves the
 * file by tens of chars and must not turn the build red; only a cut big enough
 * to change what the budget describes does.
 *
 * This is the blueprint's instance of the standard's always-loaded budget
 * (BilLogic/plus-uno-blueprint#366, BilLogic/plus-uno#417). plus-uno asserts
 * the same property inside its prompt bundler, which this repository has no
 * equivalent of; the check therefore stands alone here and mirrors the shape of
 * its sibling guards rather than the bundler's internals.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-router-budget.mjs   (also: npm run check:budget)
