/**
 * The always-loaded tier stays under a stated char budget, and the budget falls.
 *
 * A tier that bloats defeats the tier. `AGENTS.md` is handed to every session
 * before it decides anything, so every character in it is paid for by every
 * task, including the ones the character has nothing to do with — and a router
 * nobody finishes reading routes nobody. Who is in the tier, and why
 * `CONTEXT.md` and `INDEX.md` are not, is `scripts/always-loaded.mjs`.
 *
 * WHAT IS COUNTED: characters of the files in `ALWAYS_LOADED`, whole, as they
 * sit on disk. No frontmatter stripping — these files have none — and no
 * tokenisation, because a char count is the number an author can check against
 * their own editor. The report names every file it counted and its size, so a
 * total is never printed without the census behind it.
 *
 * TWO DIRECTIONS, ONE CONSTANT. `BUDGET` is a ceiling: over it, the check
 * fails. It is also a RATCHET: fall more than `SLACK` below it and the check
 * fails too, asking for the budget to be lowered. A ceiling that only ever
 * blocks is a ceiling that stops describing the file — a router shrinks when
 * its bodies move out to the documents they name, and a budget written before
 * that cut goes on passing while meaning nothing. The downward failure is the
 * cheapest possible fix, a one-line edit, and it is what makes the number a
 * promise rather than a decoration.
 *
 * `SLACK` is wide on purpose. A pointer added or a trigger reworded moves the
 * file by tens of chars and must not turn the build red; only a cut big enough
 * to change what the budget describes does.
 *
 * The two numbers are this repository's own, in `scripts/repo-config.mjs`. A
 * ceiling is set against one router; copied to another, it describes a file it
 * never measured. The mechanism is the standard's always-loaded budget and is
 * the same file in every repository that carries it.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-router-budget.mjs   (also: npm run check:budget)
