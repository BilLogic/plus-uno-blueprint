/**
 * Which SQL functions write their own row into the authoring change log.
 *
 * #176 folded `deleted_structure` into `public.authoring_changes`, which left
 * the log with two writers rather than one. The client appends through
 * `record_authoring_change` for every ordinary write; the delete functions
 * append their own row, because the payload can only be captured inside the
 * same transaction as the cascade that destroys it.
 *
 * That split needs exactly one thing to stay true: the client must skip its
 * own append for precisely the operations the database already recorded. Skip
 * too many and a delete leaves no trace; skip too few and one delete becomes
 * two rows, one of them with no payload — two records of one event, only one
 * of which can restore anything.
 *
 * `ARCHIVED_BY_THE_DATABASE` in `src/lib/authoringLog.ts` is that skip set,
 * and this is the other half of the comparison: the set read out of the SQL.
 * `scripts/tests/authoring-log.test.mjs` holds them together, so adding a
 * seventh archiving function without a line in the client fails a test rather
 * than silently double-recording.
 *
 * IT MATCHES BOTH RELATION NAMES ON PURPOSE. The migration series still says
 * `deleted_structure` inside all six bodies, because the redirect is a
 * `pg_get_functiondef` sweep that rewrites what is INSTALLED — per #148 these
 * files are not the apply path, and rewriting the bodies in place here would
 * have had to pick between the `layers` spelling the files carry and the
 * `lanes` spelling production carries. So the archivers are still spelled the
 * old way in the repository and the new way in the database, and this reads
 * either.
 *
 * IT KEYS ON `payload`, NOT ON THE RELATION. `record_authoring_change` also
 * inserts into `authoring_changes` and is not an archiver: it takes no payload
 * parameter at all, which is what stops a client from claiming to have deleted
 * something. Matching the relation alone would sweep it in and demand the
 * client skip its own append seam.
 *
 * Static, needs no database.
