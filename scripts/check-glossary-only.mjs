/**
 * `CONTEXT.md` defines the blueprint's terms and stops.
 *
 * The engineering skills this team runs assume one shape: `AGENTS.md` routes,
 * `CONTEXT.md` defines terms, `docs/adr/` holds decisions. This repository's
 * glossary had grown two reference documents inside it — a rename map of some
 * two hundred lines and an interface-to-schema map of ninety — and every
 * session that opened the file to look up one word paid for both. #365 moved
 * them out: the rename map to `scripts/retired-vocabulary.mjs`, where the
 * checks that enforce it live, and the interface map to
 * `docs/reference/interface-schema-map.md`, where one pointer reaches it.
 *
 * A file that has been cut once grows back unless something holds it. The
 * glossary already SAID it was definitions and nothing else, in its own second
 * paragraph, and said so throughout the year it was two thirds reference. This
 * is that sentence with a build behind it.
 *
 * ── THE GRAMMAR, READ OFF WHAT IS LEFT ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A glossary is headings, prose, and TERM ROWS — `**term** — definition`, the
 * shape every entry in the file already takes. The rules are three, and each
 * one names a way the file grew last time:
 *
 *   1. NO FENCED CODE BLOCK. A definition is a sentence. A fence is an example,
 *      a schema listing or a snippet — the beginning of a reference document,
 *      and reference documents are disclosed rather than always-open.
 *   2. NO TABLE NAMES A COLUMN. Both evicted maps were tables of
 *      `table.column` spans, and that is the tell: a table whose cells are
 *      schema names restates the catalog, which is what a generated reference
 *      is for. Tables as such are allowed — the file draws two, of where a
 *      spec lives and of who writes what, and neither names a column — because
 *      the rule that catches the real thing is narrower than "no tables" and
 *      needs no exemption to stay true.
 *   3. EVERY SECTION DEFINES A TERM. A `##` or `###` section with no term row
 *      in it is a body: prose that is about something other than what a word
 *      means. Both evicted sections failed this rule on the day they were
 *      written, and it is the one that catches the next one before it is a
 *      hundred lines long.
 *
 * SUBJECT is `CONTEXT.md` alone. It is named here rather than walked for,
 * because the glossary is one file by the shape's own definition: a second
 * glossary would be a second vocabulary.
 *
 * Sibling of the router's three checks (#366) — same shape, same failure
 * style, same place in `gates` — because `CONTEXT.md` is the first pointer
 * `AGENTS.md` fires and a session that reads the router reads this next.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-glossary-only.mjs   (also: npm run check:glossary)
