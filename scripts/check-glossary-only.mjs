/**
 * `CONTEXT.md` defines this repository's terms and stops.
 *
 * The engineering skills this repo routes to assume one shape: `AGENTS.md`
 * routes, `CONTEXT.md` defines terms, and the decision records hold
 * decisions. A glossary grows reference sections inside it — a rename map, an
 * interface-to-schema map, reasoning about which words a check should exempt
 * — and every session that opens the file to look up one word pays for all of
 * them. Each belongs elsewhere: a rename map beside the checks that enforce
 * it, and the interface map in the generated document
 * `repoConfig.interfaceMap` names, where one pointer reaches it.
 *
 * A file that has been cut once grows back unless something holds it. The
 * glossary already SAID it was definitions only, and went on saying it while
 * sections of it were something else. This is that sentence with a build
 * behind it.
 *
 * ── THE GRAMMAR, READ OFF WHAT IS LEFT ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A glossary is headings, prose, and TERM ROWS — `**term** — definition`, the
 * shape every entry in the file already takes. The rules are three, and each
 * one names a way the file grew last time:
 *
 *   1. NO FENCED CODE BLOCK. A definition is a sentence. A fence is an example,
 *      a schema listing or a snippet — the beginning of a reference document,
 *      and reference documents are disclosed rather than always-open.
 *   2. NO TABLE NAMES A COLUMN. Both evicted maps were tables of
 *      `table.column` spans, and that is the tell: a table whose cells are
 *      schema names restates the catalogue, which is what a generated
 *      reference is for. Tables as such are allowed — a glossary may draw one,
 *      of who writes what, and no cell of it names a column — because the rule
 *      that catches the real thing is narrower than "no tables" and needs no
 *      exemption to stay true.
 *   3. EVERY SECTION DEFINES A TERM. A `##` or `###` section with no term row
 *      in it is a body: prose that is about something other than what a word
 *      means. Every evicted section failed this rule on the day it was
 *      written, and it is the one that catches the next one before it is a
 *      hundred lines long.
 *
 * SUBJECT is `CONTEXT.md` alone. It is named here rather than walked for,
 * because the glossary is one file by the shape's own definition: a second
 * glossary would be a second vocabulary. Every repository that carries this
 * check holds its own glossary to it.
 *
 * AND A GLOSSARY WITH NO TERMS IN IT IS NOT ONE. The three rules above are all
 * written as refusals, which is the right shape for each of them and the wrong
 * shape for the whole: an emptied file breaks none of them. No fence, no
 * table, no section — nothing to fail. The run printed `0 term rows` and
 * exited 0, in the same sentence and the same green as the run over a file
 * with fifty-one. The count was already being computed and printed; it is now
 * also read, which is the difference between reporting a subject and having
 * one.
 *
 * Sibling of the router's three checks — same shape, same failure style, same
 * place in CI — because `CONTEXT.md` is the first pointer `AGENTS.md` fires
 * and a session that reads the router reads this next. Like them it is the
 * same file in every repository; the one path it names that differs, the
 * interface map, comes from `scripts/repo-config.mjs`.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-glossary-only.mjs   (also: npm run check:glossary)
