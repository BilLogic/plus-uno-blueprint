/**
 * Prohibition tokens across the always-loaded tier only fall.
 *
 * Steering by prohibition drags the forbidden behaviour into context and makes
 * it MORE available, not less — "don't think of an elephant". The fix is to
 * prompt the positive: state the target behaviour, so the banned one is never
 * spoken. A prohibition earns its place as a hard guardrail that cannot be
 * phrased positively — a rule that holds for every skill, inline in the router
 * because it binds before any pointer fires, is that category — and even then
 * it carries its positive twin.
 *
 * This is a RATCHET, not a threshold. A threshold invites arguing about the
 * number and gets switched off the day it blocks someone; a ratchet only asks
 * that the count go down. It is the standard's negation ratchet, and the same
 * file in every repository that carries it — the same metric, the same five
 * tokens and the same quoted-speech rule — so that one harness review reads
 * every repository's number the same way. Only the number is each
 * repository's own.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS COUNTED, AND WHAT IS NOT ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * PROHIBITION TOKENS: five imperative bans, and the metric is named that
 * wherever it is printed, because it is not a count of negation as written. A
 * regex broad enough to catch negation as written also catches the contrastive
 * appositive — "a variant is an alternative, not a stage" — which STATES A
 * TARGET and names the near miss beside it, so broadening the pattern would
 * penalise the writing this guard exists to encourage. Every match here is an
 * imperative ban, which is what makes the number impossible to litigate at the
 * moment it blocks someone.
 *
 * Quoted speech and code spans are exempt: `never` inside a code span is an
 * identifier, and `Say "I don't know"` is an instruction TO do something.
 *
 * SCOPE is the always-loaded tier — the files in `scripts/always-loaded.mjs`,
 * which cost every session their whole length before any task begins.
 * Everything else loads when a pointer fires, and the decision records are
 * append-only: a record saying "X is not reversible" ADDS prohibitions by
 * doing its job, so a ratchet over them would rise by construction.
 *
 * ── THE RECORDED COUNT ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `RECORDED` is the baseline, kept in `scripts/repo-config.mjs` with this
 * repository's other numbers rather than in a JSON file beside this script:
 * one place to look for every number a check holds this repository to, and a
 * script that is the same in every repository. It carries the FILE COUNT as well as the token
 * count, and a run measuring fewer files fails — a ratchet fails only when the
 * count RISES, so a corpus that lost a file clears it every time and reports a
 * smaller, greener number while doing so.
 *
 * A fall is a pass with a nudge to re-record: the count is a fact about prose,
 * and a good rewrite must never arrive as a red build. (The char budget next
 * door DOES fail downward, because a stale ceiling silently stops describing
 * the file, while a stale prohibition count still blocks every rise it was
 * recorded to block.)
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-negation-ratchet.mjs   (also: npm run check:negation)
