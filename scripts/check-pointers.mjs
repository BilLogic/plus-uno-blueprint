/**
 * Pointer sweep over the always-loaded router.
 *
 * A POINTER is a routing item that names material outside the router and the
 * branch that should reach it — a row of a routing table, a bullet of a boot
 * list, a backticked path beside a rule. Its wording, not its target, decides
 * whether the agent gets there. Three ways a router fails silently, all caught
 * here on every run:
 *
 *   1. A POINTER DOES NOT RESOLVE. A path renamed under a pointer leaves the
 *      agent told to load a document that is not there; nothing errors, the
 *      agent guesses. Same failure as a stale path in prose, one layer up.
 *      Where the pointer names a section (`path.md` § Heading), the heading is
 *      checked too, case-insensitively, so a section renamed under a pointer
 *      is caught the same way.
 *   2. A POINTER BURIES ITS TRIGGER. An always-loaded pointer is scanned, not
 *      read; the first word is where it does its triggering work. "Any task
 *      that writes data" makes the agent read "Any" before it learns the item
 *      is about writes.
 *   3. A ROUTING ITEM CARRIES NO POINTER AT ALL. That is a body living in the
 *      router: prose every session pays for, in the one file that is supposed
 *      to route rather than teach. It belongs in the document it names.
 *
 * ── THE UNIT IS THE ITEM, NOT THE LINE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A ROUTING ITEM is a list item — bulleted or numbered — or a table row,
 * together with its wrapped continuation lines. The unit is the item because
 * prose wraps: a pointer commonly lands on the second physical line of an item,
 * and demanding that every such line lead with a trigger word would be a rule
 * about where the paragraph broke.
 *
 * ITS LEADING WORD is the first word of the item — of its first cell, for a
 * table row — after the list marker, markdown emphasis and any backticks are
 * stripped, lowercased and reduced to letters and hyphens. That word must not
 * be one of `FILLER`, the words that carry no branch.
 *
 * THE RULES THAT HOLD FOR EVERY SKILL ARE EXEMPT FROM RULES 2 AND 3, and only
 * from those. They are rules rather than routes — they bind before any pointer
 * could fire, which is why they are inline at all — so "state the branch
 * first" does not apply and neither does "carry a pointer". Their pointers,
 * where they have them, still have to resolve: a rule that cites a reference
 * is citing it for a reader who needs the body. The exemption is keyed to the
 * section heading naming `EXEMPT_SECTION`, so it is a property of where the
 * item lives rather than a list of item texts that quietly stops matching.
 *
 * SUBJECTS are the always-loaded tier (`scripts/always-loaded.mjs`), and the
 * sweep is by structure rather than by a list of pointers, so a pointer added
 * tomorrow is swept tomorrow.
 *
 * The same file in every repository that carries it — same pointer grammar,
 * same filler set, same exempt section, same failure shape — so that one
 * harness review reads every router the same way. `py` is in the extension
 * list because a router may point at a Python validator or hook, and without
 * it that pointer would read as prose and go unswept, which is the one failure
 * this check exists to prevent. A router that names its inline rules something
 * other than `EXEMPT_SECTION` renames the heading, not the constant: the
 * category is one category wherever it sits.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-pointers.mjs   (also: npm run check:pointers)

 * looked in. Nothing is asked of it for a pointer that is not into the
