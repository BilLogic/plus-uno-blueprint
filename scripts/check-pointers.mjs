/**
 * Pointer sweep over the always-loaded router.
 *
 * A POINTER is a routing item that names material outside the router and the
 * branch that should reach it — a row of § Progressive loading, a numbered step
 * of § Boot protocol, a backticked path beside a security line. Its wording,
 * not its target, decides whether the agent gets there. Three ways a router
 * fails silently, all caught here on every run:
 *
 *   1. A POINTER DOES NOT RESOLVE. A path renamed under a pointer leaves the
 *      agent told to load a document that is not there; nothing errors, the
 *      agent guesses. Same failure as a stale schema name in prose
 *      (`a-doc-names-the-schema-it-has.test.mjs`), one layer up. Where the
 *      pointer names a section (`path.md` § Heading), the heading is checked
 *      too, case-insensitively, so a section renamed under a pointer is caught
 *      the same way.
 *   2. A POINTER BURIES ITS TRIGGER. An always-loaded pointer is scanned, not
 *      read; the first word is where it does its triggering work. "Any task
 *      that writes data" makes the agent read "Any" before it learns the item
 *      is about writes.
 *   3. A ROUTING ITEM CARRIES NO POINTER AT ALL. That is a body living in the
 *      router: prose every session pays for, in the one file that is supposed
 *      to route rather than teach. It belongs in the document it names.
 *
 * ── THE UNIT IS THE ITEM, NOT THE LINE ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A ROUTING ITEM is a list item — bulleted or numbered — or a table row,
 * together with its wrapped continuation lines. The unit is the item because
 * prose wraps: a pointer commonly lands on the second physical line of an item,
 * and demanding that every such line lead with a trigger word would be a rule
 * about where the paragraph broke.
 *
 * ITS LEADING WORD is the first word of the item — of its first cell, for a
 * table row — after the list marker, markdown emphasis and any backticks are
 * stripped, lowercased and reduced to letters and hyphens. That word must not
 * be one of `FILLER`, the words that carry no branch.
 *
 * SECURITY LINES ARE EXEMPT FROM RULES 2 AND 3, and only from those. They are
 * rules rather than routes — they bind before any pointer could fire, which is
 * why they are inline at all — so "state the branch first" does not apply and
 * neither does "carry a pointer". Their pointers, where they have them, still
 * have to resolve: a security line that cites a section is citing it for a
 * reader who needs the body. The exemption is keyed to the section heading
 * naming `EXEMPT_SECTION`, so it is a property of where the item lives rather
 * than a list of item texts that quietly stops matching.
 *
 * SUBJECTS are the always-loaded tier (`scripts/always-loaded.mjs`), and the
 * sweep is by structure rather than by a list of pointers, so a pointer added
 * tomorrow is swept tomorrow.
 *
 * Mirrors plus-uno's `scripts/check-pointers.mjs` (BilLogic/plus-uno#420) —
 * same pointer grammar, same filler set, same failure shape — so that one
 * harness review reads both repositories the same way. It differs in two
 * places, both because this router has a different shape: pointers here may
 * name a directory (`docs/plans/`), and triggers are read from every routing
 * item rather than from one named table.
 *
 * Run: node scripts/check-pointers.mjs   (also: npm run check:pointers)
