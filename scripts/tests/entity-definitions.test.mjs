/**
 * #140 — the app says what a phase, a scenario, a path, a step, a lane and a
 * service IS, and it says it somewhere a phone can reach.
 *
 * The ticket asked for a guard that an entity kind without a definition fails.
 * That is the first of the two here, and it is the smaller one. The second is
 * the one worth having: **a definition is never on a `Tooltip`.**
 *
 * Base UI's tooltip opens on hover and on focus and on nothing else — its
 * hover interaction is `mouseOnly` and it has no press to fall back on — so
 * every definition this app owned was invisible on the phone posture it
 * actually ships (`useMobileShell`, a full-width bottom sheet). Six
 * `PanelTermLabel` sites, every `PanelKindBadge description=`, the owner hint,
 * and all three path/scenario/phase descriptions were dead there, and nothing
 * said so. Six fixes are worth less than the test that catches the seventh.
 *
 * Neither guard is a snapshot of today's tree. The first reads the kind union
 * from `EntityDetailContext` rather than a list written here, so a seventh
 * entity kind fails until it defines itself. The second reads every
 * `<Tooltip>` element in `src`, so the next one is in the subject whatever
 * file it is written in.
 *
 * Both are proved to go red, in the shape `scripts/tests/rls-posture.test.mjs`
 * argues for: a check that is green against this tree could equally be a check
 * that examines nothing.
