/**
 * A definition hangs off a BADGE, never off a label.
 *
 * Six panel labels carried one — `Status`, `Summary`, `Position`, `Paths`,
 * `Dependencies`, `Resources` — and every one of them is ordinary English in
 * a form. A reader who cannot guess what a field called Summary holds is not
 * helped by a sentence saying it holds a summary, and a definition on every
 * label teaches that hovering is worth doing about eleven times before it
 * teaches anything at all. What earns a definition is a word this app made up
 * (#244).
 *
 * A badge is the shape that word wears. It is one fact about the thing it
 * sits on, drawn from a vocabulary rather than typed by an author, and the
 * app already renders every such word that way — a path's kind, a cell's
 * status, a lane's stakeholder. So the rule is checkable rather than tasteful:
 * not "is this word jargon", which drifts on the next term somebody adds, but
 * "is the thing this definition is attached to a badge".
 *
 * THE SUBJECT IS THE RAW CARD, `DefinitionPopover`, AND NOT THE PAGE. A sweep
 * of `src/` for the classes a definition used to wear would need an exemption
 * for every legitimate underline in the app, and the classes are gone anyway
 * (#243). `EntityDefinitionPopover` is deliberately NOT swept: its `kind` is
 * typed to `EntityKindTerm`, so its vocabulary is already finite and already
 * checked by the compiler, and it is the one surface allowed to hang off bare
 * text — the step and lane column headers on the board, which teach the words
 * before anything is opened.
 *
 * A PASS-THROUGH IS NOT A CALL SITE. A component whose popover wraps its own
 * `children` is building a definition surface for somebody else to use; it
 * cannot know what it will be handed and is not the place to decide. That
 * test is what keeps this check free of an exemption list: nothing is pardoned
 * by name, and a new wrapper is covered by the same sentence.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: which WORD a definition is about. That a badge reading
 * `Social Media` gets no definition while `Live` keeps one is a fact about the
 * term maps, and it is the type system that holds it — `ENTITY_STATUS_MEANING`
 * is keyed by `EntityStatus` and `ENTITY_KIND_DEFINITIONS` by `EntityKindTerm`.
 * This guard checks the shape a definition hangs from, and trusts those keys
 * for what it says.
 *
 * Run: npm test
