/**
 * A badge's size is decided in `ui/badge.tsx`, or at every call site at once.
 *
 * The badge variant defines one geometry — `h-5 px-2 py-0.5 text-xs` — and has
 * no size variant at all. Every deviation found on 2026-09-01 was a call-site
 * override, and four of them carried an `!` prefix. That prefix is the tell:
 * it exists only to beat the base variant's specificity, so each was written
 * in isolation against a shape someone else had already chosen. The result was
 * three badge sizes on one panel with no rule a reader could infer.
 *
 * No `size` variant is added, deliberately (#236). A variant would give the
 * sprawl a nicer spelling and let it come straight back, so the check is on
 * the override itself.
 *
 * THE SUBJECT IS WHAT A CALL SITE PASSES TO A BADGE, NOT A SWEEP FOR SIZE
 * UTILITIES. `text-2xs` is legal on any of the hundred spans that are not
 * badges, so a repository-wide sweep would need an exemption for each one —
 * "dozens of entries, each one a place to hide something real", as
 * `check-retired-identifiers` puts it. A className handed to `<Badge>` is a
 * subject that needs no exemptions.
 *
 * A BADGE IS NOT ONLY `<Badge>`. `PathLabelBadge`, `StatusBadge` and
 * `ScenarioTitleBadge` each take a `className` and hand it to `Badge`, so a
 * size passed to one of them lands on a badge just as surely — and two did.
 * Those wrappers are DISCOVERED rather than listed: a component that renders
 * `<Badge>` with its own `className` in the class expression is a badge call
 * site, and the next wrapper someone writes is covered on the day it is
 * written rather than the day somebody remembers this list.
 *
 * WHAT IT CANNOT SEE: a size that reaches a badge without being written at a
 * call site — through a shared constant, a `style` prop, or a wrapper that
 * renames `className` to something else on the way through. Those are worth
 * knowing about and none exist today; the check is not evidence they never
 * will.
 *
 * Run: npm test
