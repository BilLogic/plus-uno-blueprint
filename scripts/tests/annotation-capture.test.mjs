/**
 * The agent's marker pen finds the canvas by a DOM ATTRIBUTE, and nothing
 * type-checks a querySelector string against the element that carries it.
 *
 * `56c25f5` ("layers becomes lanes, the last rename in the block") swept the
 * word into `data-canvas-annotation-lane` on the element while four readers
 * kept asking for `[data-canvas-annotation-layer]`. The annotation layer is a
 * RENDERING layer — the same false positive `retired-copy.test.mjs` already
 * excludes data attributes for — so the element was renamed and the swimlane
 * was never involved.
 *
 * What it cost: `registerAgentAnnotator` returns "No annotatable canvas is
 * open right now." when its query misses, so `annotate_cells` failed on every
 * call, on every board, with a sentence that reads like a normal empty state.
 * A silent tool, not a crash.
 *
 * So the attribute is asserted from BOTH ends: the element that emits it and
 * every selector that looks for it, as text, because that is the join the
 * compiler cannot make.
