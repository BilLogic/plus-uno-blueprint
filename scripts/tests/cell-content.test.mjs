/**
 * Phase 4 logic that is worth testing without a browser.
 *
 * Two things here can lose data silently, which is why they get tests rather
 * than a click-through:
 *
 * 1. `updateCellResources` REPLACES a cell's resources. It used to rewrite a
 *    jsonb array that also held touchpoint detail and provenance citations,
 *    and had to filter itself to avoid deleting them on every save.
 *    20260830280000 moved the three contents apart, so the filter is gone,
 *    and what is asserted here is that the whole list — and only this cell's
 *    list — goes to the database in one call.
 * 2. A resource URL that is not `https:` must be refused rather than coerced.
 *
 * Run: npm test

/**

 * `rows` is what `.select()` resolves with — the whole point of the second
 * test group below. PostgREST answers a matched-nothing update with
 * `{ data: [], error: null }`, so an empty array here is a *successful*
 * response that wrote nothing.
 *
 * A content write also brings the cell's touchpoint placements into line with
 * the text, through one `sync_cell_touchpoints` RPC. It is stubbed here as a
 * no-op returning nothing removed: these tests are about the content write
 * and its matched-nothing detection. Which cells the sync acts on, and what
 * it does to them, is decided inside the function and proved in its own
 * migration, because a client-side assertion can no longer see it.
