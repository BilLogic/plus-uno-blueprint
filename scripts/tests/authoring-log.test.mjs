/**
 * The one seam between the log's two writers, held from both sides.
 *
 * #176 gives `public.authoring_changes` two writers, and it has to. The client
 * appends every ordinary write through `record_authoring_change`; the delete
 * functions append their own row, because a deleted row's payload can only be
 * captured inside the transaction that destroys it.
 *
 * That leaves exactly one way for the two halves to disagree, and it is
 * silent in both directions:
 *
 *   - a delete function the client does NOT skip records twice, once with the
 *     payload and once without, and the second row looks exactly like a
 *     record of the same event while being unable to restore anything
 *   - a delete function the client skips that does NOT archive records
 *     nothing at all, which is the defect #176 exists to end
 *
 * `ARCHIVED_BY_THE_DATABASE` is one half. The set read out of the migrations
 * is the other. Neither derives from the other — same shape and same argument
 * as the rename map's two lists — so this test is what makes them one fact.
 *
 * The fixtures below are the part worth reading: the check is green against
 * the repository, which means the green run is not evidence it looks at
 * anything. Each red case is a shape the scanner has to report, written out so
 * that a scanner that stopped examining its subject fails here first.
 *
 * Run: npm test
