/**
 * A PostgREST embed of a multiply-reachable table must name its foreign key.
 *
 * `cells` reaches `lanes` two ways: `cells_lane_id_fkey` on `(lane_id)`, and
 * the composite `cells_path_matches_lane_fkey` on `(lane_id, path_id)` that
 * enforces a cell's lane belonging to its path. PostgREST will not choose
 * between them — it answers `PGRST201`, a 300 listing the candidates, and the
 * client throws.
 *
 * `useStepSpec` asked for `lanes!inner(...)` with no hint. It was the FOURTH
 * of four queries in that hook and the only decorative one — the storyboard
 * frames — so a lookup for pictures failed the whole hook, and every step
 * panel in the app read "That step could not be loaded." The panel then
 * swallowed `result.message`, so the 300 never reached anyone; what the reader
 * saw was a breadcrumb that had degraded to the bare word "Step".
 *
 * `workflowQueries.ts` already documents this exact trap for `resources` —
 * "PostgREST answers an ambiguous embed with a 300 listing the candidates
 * rather than with rows" — and hints it correctly. The knowledge was in the
 * repository; nothing enforced it. This is the enforcement.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CAN AND CANNOT SEE. The pairs below were read from production's
 * `pg_constraint`, not inferred: the static replay in `migration-replay.mjs`
 * records a constraint as `{table, name}` with no target and no columns, so
 * there is no way to derive them from the files today. That makes this list a
 * FIXTURE, and a fixture can go stale — so the live half of the argument is
 * `npm run check:contract:live`, and the honest scope of this test is "the
 * ambiguity we know about cannot come back". Widening it to every embed needs
 * the replay to model foreign keys first; that is worth doing and is not this.
 *
 * Run: npm test
