/**
 * A PostgREST alias can reintroduce a word the database retired.
 *
 * `path_type:kind` in a select string is not a column. It is an instruction to
 * PostgREST to hand the row back with the field called `path_type` — the name
 * `20260830190000` renamed away. One such alias put a retired word into 295
 * references across 73 files, and no check in this repository could see it:
 * `check-retired-identifiers` sweeps database identifiers and this is not one,
 * `the-snapshot-is-not-a-museum` sweeps the schema snapshot and this is not
 * there either. The word re-entered through the gap between them.
 *
 * `workflowQueries.ts` called its alias "deliberate and temporary" and named
 * the issue that would remove it. That issue closed on 2026-08-31 without
 * removing it. Temporary became permanent by the quietest route there is, and
 * a comment is what failed to stop it, so this is a check instead.
 *
 * THE SUBJECT IS THE ALIAS, NOT THE PROSE — and that narrowing is the whole
 * design. `check-retired-identifiers` argues at length that a check which
 * greps prose needs an exemption for every filename and every sentence, "dozens
 * of entries, each one a place to hide something real." That argument applies
 * here with force: `src/` holds Tailwind's `hover:text`, `visible:ring` and 115
 * more colon pairs per variant, so a repository-wide sweep for `word:word`
 * would be exemptions all the way down. An alias in a select string is the one
 * construct that can rename a live column to a retired word for every consumer
 * at once, it has exact syntax, and it lives only where a select string lives.
 * That is a subject small enough to check without exempting anything.
 *
 * Run: npm test
