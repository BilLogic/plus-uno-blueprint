/**
 * The check that keeps `CONTEXT.md` a glossary, proven by glossaries that break
 * it (#365).
 *
 * A guard seen only passing is not evidence. The committed glossary passes
 * today and would pass just as quietly if the check had stopped looking, so
 * every rule is driven from a fixture that violates it — a code fence, a table
 * of column names, a section that defines nothing — and the committed file is
 * asserted last, as one case among several rather than as the whole suite.
 *
 * Fixtures rather than the real file, in the shape
 * `the-router-is-a-router.test.mjs` uses: `findings` is pure, so a failing
 * branch can be asserted without the document the check protects ever being
 * edited.
 *
 * The two rules the acceptance criteria name — a code fence, a column table —
 * were also run against the committed glossary by hand, red then restored,
 * because a fixture proves the parser and only the real file proves the wiring.
