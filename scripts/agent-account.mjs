/**
 * A deployment's agent-facing account of the schema — the pure half.
 *
 * `docs/agents/blueprint.md` has two kinds of section. The hand-written core
 * says what the catalog cannot: how to read a cell, what absence means, what
 * a status licenses an agent to say, how paths relate to a scenario's main
 * route. The generated sections say what the code and the catalog already
 * say, and are RENDERED from them rather than written a third time:
 *
 *   vocabulary   from `ENTITY_KIND_DEFINITIONS` in the application's
 *                `lib/panelTerms.ts` — the six kinds the board defines for a
 *                reader, read off the source text
 *   schema       from `public.schema_comments()` (pg_description, live) laid
 *                over the column inventory in the reading repository's
 *                `types/database.ts`, so an undescribed column shows as a gap
 *                rather than vanishing
 *
 * Two numbers ratchet against docs/reference/agent-account-baseline.json:
 * column-comment coverage, which may only rise, and the count of
 * prohibitions in the hand-written core, which may only fall. Instructions
 * phrased as what to do are what an agent can act on; "never X" leaves it
 * guessing what to do instead.
 *
 * WHO OWNS WHICH SOURCE. The vocabulary is the APPLICATION'S: the six kinds
 * are how the board defines itself to a reader, and they travel with whichever
 * copy of the application is running — so a deployment that reads the
 * application out of this package reads the same six, and `vocabularySource`
 * follows the application into `node_modules`. The schema is the DATABASE'S: a
 * deployment extends the template, so which relations exist and what columns
 * they carry is a fact about ITS database and no other. That is why
 * `schemaDeclaration` looks in the deployment's own root before this tree's,
 * and why what this package ships is only the last of three — a default, not
 * the truth.
 *
 * AND THE DATABASE HAS THE LAST WORD. A declaration is a list of relations to
 * ASK the database about; `reconcile` renders only what the answers confirmed.
 * A declared relation the database does not have is dropped, a declared column
 * it does not have is dropped, and a column it has that no declaration
 * mentions is rendered anyway. So the rendering is monotone in accuracy: the
 * command a red check prints can only move the document toward the database,
 * never away from it, whatever the declaration it started from said. The
 * disagreements come back as notes for the deployment to fold into its own
 * declaration, and none of them is a failure — a deployment is entitled to a
 * schema this package never had.
 *
 * Pure: reads text and paths, returns text and paths. Every answer that needs
 * a filesystem or a database is taken by `generate-agent-account.mjs` and
 * handed in. With no database connected that script generates nothing, so this
 * module is the whole of what CI can hold.
