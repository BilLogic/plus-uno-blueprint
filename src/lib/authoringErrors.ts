    THE ONE SIDE EFFECT IN THIS FILE, and it is here because this is the only
    funnel every failed write passes through. There is no single place those
    failures are CAUGHT — each call site raises and the surface above it
    renders — so a translation function is the one seam they share. Putting
    the reconcile at each call site would be dozens of edits that drift, and
    putting it behind a react-query `MutationCache` would cover nothing,
    because the app has no `useMutation` anywhere.

    "Every failed write" is a claim, so it is checked rather than asserted:
    `writeBoundaryContract.test.ts` walks the write-owning modules and fails on
    any `throw new Error(error.message)`. Closing that gap is what made the
    claim true — the whole `*SpecMutations` family used to raise the database's
    own text straight at the reader, which is the thing `AuthoringError.raw`
    exists to prevent, and no reconcile fired for any of them.

    It is safe to sit on a translation path: fire-and-forget, guarded against
    bursts, and a no-op until `SupabaseProvider` registers a reconciler. See
    `sessionReconcile.ts` for why a denial is the right trigger (#136).
