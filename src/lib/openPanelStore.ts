/**
 * Which panel owns the drawer — one fact, one owner.
 *
 * The cell panel and the entity panels (lane, phase, scenario) are separate
 * React contexts rendering separate drawers, and only one may be open: they
 * occupy the same screen position, and each portals its Save/Cancel row into a
 * global DOM id. Two providers cannot see each other's state, so the exclusion
 * lives here instead of in either of them.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT a second boolean beside each panel's own open state. Each
 * panel still owns "am I open"; this owns "who is allowed to be", and a panel
 * that loses the claim closes itself. The alternative — each provider setting
 * the other's state — is two owners of one fact reconciled asynchronously,
 * which is the bug class the cell panel's own `open` had to be rewritten to
 * escape.
