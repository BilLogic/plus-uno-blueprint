/*
 * Blueprint colour vocabulary — two sets, deliberately disjoint.
 *
 * A LANE ROLE says what a swim lane *is*: evidence, actor, frontstage tech. Not
 * what colour it is. Naming lanes after hues is what made this hard to reason
 * about — `chartreuse` told you nothing about a blueprint, and stopped even
 * being true once fills became scale steps. A role survives a repalette.
 *
 * A TOUCHPOINT TONE is the colour someone picked for a tool. That one really is
 * a colour choice — "Zoom is blue" is the blueprint owner's decision — so
 * naming it after the hue is honest here where it was not for lanes.
 *
 * The two sets share no family, so a pill can never be mistaken for the lane it
 * sits in, whichever tone is picked.
 *
 * Which family each maps to lives in blueprint.css, keyed on
 * `data-blueprint-lane` / `data-blueprint-tone`. Nothing here assigns a colour.
