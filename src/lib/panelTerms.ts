/**
 * The words this app made up, defined once.
 *
 * TWO, and that is the point of #244. There were eleven, and nine of them were
 * ordinary English on a form label — `Status`, `Summary`, `Position`, `Paths`,
 * `Dependencies`, `Resources`. A definition on every label teaches a reader
 * that hovering is worth doing about eleven times before it teaches anything,
 * and the words that genuinely needed explaining were the ones that got lost
 * in it.
 *
 * What survives is what a reader could not guess from English: a STORYBOARD is
 * not a story, and a TOUCHPOINT is not a point. Both once rendered as outline
 * badges; #307 demotes them to plain field labels, so each reads beside
 * Summary, Status and Owner rather than as a mystery tag stacked among value
 * badges. The definition rides the label's own hint popover — the touch/press
 * affordance every other field label already uses.
 *
 * That deliberately reopens #244 for exactly these two invented words: a
 * definition may hang off a label here because the label names a word this app
 * made up, not ordinary English on a form. The shape they take now is `Field`,
 * which the badge-rule check exempts as a field explaining its own input
 * (`scripts/tests/a-definition-hangs-off-a-badge.test.mjs`).
 *
 * `evidence` was listed to survive too (#244), on the belief that it was
 * already a badge. It was a TAB, beside Dependencies and Resources, and a tab
 * is a label — so all three lost theirs together rather than one of them being
 * singled out for a definition its neighbours could not have.
 *
 * Each entry is a card SECTION's body, under an eyebrow that already prints
 * the term, so neither opens by naming the term again.

 * assumption that a reader who opened the panel knows what kind of thing they
 * opened it on. #140 is that assumption failing: a panel full of a lane's
 * contents answers "what is in this lane" and never "what is a lane".
 *
 * These hang off the entity's own label ON THE BOARD, not off the panel badge.
 * A reader who does not know what a lane is has that question while looking at
 * the board, before anything is opened — and an explanation that arrives only
 * after the click is an explanation for somebody who no longer needs it.
 *
 * `label` is the word as the popover prints it; `definition` is the sentence.
 * One entry per kind and no exemptions: a reader learns the shape once — kind
 * above the rule, this instance below it — and it never varies.
