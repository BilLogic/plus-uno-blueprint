/**
 * What counts as scrollable inside the canvas — decided ONCE, for both input
 * paths that need the answer.
 *
 * The wheel path always knew: a delta over an overflowing region belongs to
 * that region, not to the camera (an overflowing grid, a text editor).
 * The touch path answered the opposite question by never asking it — every
 * `touchmove` in the subtree was prevented, on the stated grounds that the
 * board holds no scrollable region. It does: `ServiceBlueprintGrid` renders
 * one a few levels inside the viewport, so a finger could not reach rows the
 * same wheel reached happily.
 *
 * Both paths now walk this one function, which is why they cannot drift apart
 * again. They differ only in what they do with the answer, and that difference
 * is honest: the wheel knows its direction and can hand a delta on to the
 * camera when the region has hit its end (native scroll chaining), while a
 * touch is claimed or released before the finger has said which way it is
 * going.
