/**
 * Bringing the UI's idea of what it may write back in line with the database's.
 *
 * The tier a surface gates on comes from the local session's
 * `app_metadata.role`. That is re-derived whenever the access token refreshes
 * — `autoRefreshToken` is on and `SupabaseProvider` subscribes to
 * `onAuthStateChange` — so a server-side demotion reaches the UI within one
 * token lifetime on its own. The gap is the window before that refresh, where
 * the reader is still offered editing affordances the database will refuse.
 *
 * This is a UI defect and not an authorization hole: RLS re-evaluates
 * `auth.jwt()` on every statement, so the write fails at the database rather
 * than succeeding. The symptom is a button that lies (#136).
 *
 * So: reconcile at the exact moment the lie is exposed. A write that comes back
 * denied is the one reliable signal that the local tier is stale, and it costs
 * nothing on the happy path — no timer, no polling, no round-trip until
 * something has already gone wrong.
 *
 * A REGISTRATION SEAM rather than a direct import, because the client lives in
 * `SupabaseProvider` and `src/lib/` must not reach up into `src/contexts/`.

/**
 * The reconcile `SupabaseProvider` registers: refresh, and fail loudly if the
 * refresh failed.
 *
 * It lives here rather than inline in the provider for one reason, and the
 * reason is a trap. **`refreshSession()` RESOLVES on failure.** auth-js catches
 * `AuthError` and hands it back in `{ data, error }` instead of rejecting
 * (`GoTrueClient.refreshSession`, which returns through `_returnResult`). A
 * reconciler written as `await client.auth.refreshSession()` therefore always
 * succeeds, `reconcileSessionAfterDenial`'s `.catch` is unreachable, and the
 * only test that appeared to cover it was passing a hand-written rejecting
 * function — exercising the guard, never the thing registered.
 *
 * Typed against the shape it uses rather than `SupabaseClient` so a test can
 * supply one without a client.
