/**
 * Every revert a mutation can record must be one executeRevert can perform.
 *
 * `WriteFn` already buys a compile-time guarantee for `describeChange` — add a
 * write and forget its sentence and the build breaks. That guard was pointed at
 * the switch that writes the ledger's *prose*. The switch that performs the
 * *undo* had none, and the gap cost exactly what you would expect: the two
 * service mutations recorded `fn: 'update_service_summary'` and
 * `'update_business_model'`, executeRevert had no case for either, and both
 * fell to a default branch that calls `client.rpc(fn, args)` — a Postgres
 * function that has never existed. Every service edit shipped an undo button
 * that could only 404, and nothing failed until a human pressed it.
 *
 * This test reads both files as text rather than importing them. executeRevert
 * needs a live Supabase client to run, and the question here is not what it
 * does but which names it knows — which is a fact about the source, and
 * readable without standing up a database.
