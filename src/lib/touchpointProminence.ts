/**
 * Whether a touchpoint is the point of this moment, or merely present at it.

 * `cell_touchpoints.prominence` sits on the PLACEMENT and not on the catalog
 * entry, and that is the whole idea: a poster is core at recruitment and
 * incidental three phases later, so the same artifact is both depending on
 * where you are standing. A column on `touchpoints` could only ever answer
 * "how important is this tool", which is a question about the tool rather
 * than about the service.
 *
 * ── The third state is the common one ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * There are two values in the check constraint and THREE states a reader can
 * meet, because the column is nullable and most placements will never be
 * marked. Unmarked is not a quiet `peripheral`: it means nobody has judged
 * this placement, and rendering it as anything — a grey badge, a dash, the
 * word "Unmarked" — would put a judgement on screen that nobody made. So the
 * read side renders NOTHING for null, and only the editor names the state, in
 * a control where "leave it unmarked" has to be a choosable option.
 *
 * That asymmetry is deliberate and is the reason this file exists rather than
 * the two strings being inlined: a label list that says what unset means is
 * the thing that stops the next reader from adding a third badge.
