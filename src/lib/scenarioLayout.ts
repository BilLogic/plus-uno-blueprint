/**
 * Persist a scenario's layout when this session may, and say which happened.
 *
 * One decision, made once. Every caller of the display setter — the header
 * toggle, the phase-wide filter, the agent's `set_scenario_view` — goes
 * through this, so there is exactly one place that knows an editor's choice
 * is a row and a viewer's choice is not:
 *
 *   - an editor (`canWrite`) writes `scenarios.layout` through the recorded
 *     `update_scenario_layout`, inverse included, and the structure queries
 *     refetch so the stored value comes back as the slide's own `viewType`;
 *   - anon and view-only sessions hold no write on the column, so their
 *     choice is `session-only` and lives in the editor's override map.
 *
 * `previous` is what the reader was LOOKING AT — override included — because
 * that is what "take it back" has to restore; the row may have said
 * something else all along.
