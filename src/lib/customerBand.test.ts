/**
 * The customer side of a board is a BAND, and a band has one floor.
 *
 * The line of interaction is the boundary between the people the service is
 * for and the machinery that serves them, so a board draws it once however
 * many rows sit on the customer's own side. Four things decide where it goes
 * or read where it went — the renderer, the divider-row count, the corridor
 * reserved under a row, and the tone a lane label is written in — and each
 * has to ask the question about the BOARD. Ask it about a lane alone and the
 * answer is the old one, which is right only while the band is one row deep.
 *
 * Every assertion below states a position relative to the line, or an
 * equality between what is counted and what is drawn. None of them counts the
 * boards that happen to have a deep customer side: such a count would pass on
 * the day it was written and say nothing about the rule.
