/**
 * A failed write says so — and says it where the person is looking.
 *
 * Three halves, in descending order of how much they can see.
 *
 * The rendering half asserts the message a user actually reads, because "the
 * failure reached the console" is precisely the behaviour this replaces.
 *
 * The ⌘Z half drives the whole path: a real key press, a revert that rejects,
 * a notice on screen. That is the case the surface was built for — the undo
 * has no control of its own to report into — so it is the one that gets stood
 * up rather than read.
 *
 * The contract half reads the remaining three paths as source, and this is
 * the compromise: each is an event handler wired into a canvas, a sidebar or
 * a context menu, and standing all of them up would test the harness rather
 * than the honesty. It used to assert the absence of four exact strings, one
 * of which pinned ten spaces of indentation — a reformat would have made it
 * vacuously true. It now asserts a shape instead: every `catch` block in
 * those files reports through `reportWriteFailure`, with whitespace collapsed
 * first so that only the channel is being read, never the layout.
