 *
 * This is a per-slot merge, so it is independent of the branch-canvas data
 * gate: it needs no long shared RUNS of columns (the measured median was
 * 13% spine coverage), only agreement inside individual slots. Cell height
 * grows exactly where paths disagree, and that vertical swell IS the diff
 * signal — no extra paint beyond the existing divergent-column tint.
 *
 * Every sub-cell keeps its own real `cellId`, so the 1:1 selection
 * machinery (`selectionContext`, `data-blueprint-cell`, focusCells/pulse,
 * agent `focus_cell`) keeps working unchanged. Nothing here invents a
 * composite id.
