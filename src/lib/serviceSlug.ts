/**
 * A service's route slug — its own `slug` column, with a name-derived fallback.
 *
 * A deployment routes by service slug (#303/#335): `/<slug>` opens that
 * service. #335 shipped this by DERIVING the slug from the name, because
 * production had dropped the `slug` column (the initial schema had it; it was
 * dropped out of band). #341 re-added the column
 * (`20260902230000_a_service_slug_is_a_column_again`), so the slug is now the
 * service's OWN identity: stable across renames, unique by constraint. This
 * module reads that column.
 *
 * The name-derivation stays as a DEFENSIVE fallback, for a row whose slug is
 * somehow null — the column is nullable, so a deployer who clears the slug gets
 * the name-derived route rather than a broken one. The derivation mirrors the
 * database's `key_slug`: lowercase, every run of non-alphanumerics becomes a
 * single hyphen, ends trimmed; a name that slugifies to nothing (all non-ASCII)
 * falls back to the row id, so every service still has a stable, unique,
 * resolvable slug even with no column value.
