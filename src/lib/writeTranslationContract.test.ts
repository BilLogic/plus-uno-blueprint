/**
 * A write that is refused is translated, never forwarded raw.
 *
 * `AuthoringError` exists so that a person reads a sentence and the console
 * reads Postgres. A module that raises `new Error(error.message)` around it
 * sends the database's own text to the panel — `new row violates row-level
 * security policy for table "phases"` is not something to show a reader — and
 * discards `.raw`, which is the only place the original survives.
 *
 * Since the funnel gained a side effect, a module that routes around it loses
 * more than the phrasing: `toAuthoringError` is where an authorization denial
 * re-derives the session tier, so a raw raise is also a refused write that
 * leaves the UI still offering the button the database just refused.
 *
 * The rule is scoped to the modules that WRITE, and deliberately not wider. A
 * hook raising `error.message` from a `.select()` is a different problem with
 * a different answer: a failed read has no authoring failure to phrase, and
 * widening this to every file would make it a list of exemptions rather than a
 * rule. `lib/*Mutations.ts` is matched by shape, because adding one is the
 * sanctioned way to add a write and should not need an edit here.
 *
 * The pattern is anchored at `lib/` on purpose: a `components/FooMutations.ts`
 * is not a mutation module, it is this test being routed around.
