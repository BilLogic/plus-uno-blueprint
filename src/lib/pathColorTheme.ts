 * Radix step 1100, not the Tailwind v3 defaults these used to be (#10B981 and
 * friends). The step is what makes these fills carriable: the old values
 * measured 2.0–2.9:1 against the ink a badge puts on them — the amber one
 * worst. Step 11 is Radix's text weight; `palette.test.ts` measures every
 * entry's DERIVED ink (see `[data-blueprint-fill]` in blueprint.css) against
 * the stylesheet to keep that true.
 *
 * Historical note, since the reasoning below reads oddly otherwise: these
 * were chosen when badges spelled `text-white` at eight call sites. The ink
 * is derived from the fill now, so the constraint is no longer "legible under
 * white" but "yields legible ink" — which these already satisfy.
 *
 * `unhappy` is orange rather than amber for the same reason: amber's step
 * 9/10 are near-yellow and carry almost no contrast either way, so the whole
 * family would have had to be read at a different step from every other path
 * type.
