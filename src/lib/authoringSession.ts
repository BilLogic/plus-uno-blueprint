 * keep. Entries that captured an inverse carry it in `revert`, and the sheet
 * offers a per-row revert; entries without one (deletes, changes recorded
 * before their before-state was captured) simply show no revert control.
 *
 * Module-level rather than React state because `call()` is a plain function
 * with no component around it. Subscribers read through `useSyncExternalStore`.
