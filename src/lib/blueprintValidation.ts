 *
 * - The roles are `frontstage_tech`, not `front_stage_tech`. Only `visual` and
 *   the four stage roles carry one; actor lanes and Support Actions have none,

 *   no stage boundary.
 * - **Tech sits above actions**, which reverses the usual textbook order. That
 *   was a deliberate change — see the `stage_tech_before_actions_layer_order`
 *   migration — and a new blueprint that ordered them the other way would not
 *   line up against any existing one in the side-by-side view.
