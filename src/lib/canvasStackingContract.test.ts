/**
 * The canvas stacking order, as far as a file can hold it.
 *
 * This used to pin `"lane === 'forward' ? 'z-0' : 'z-[30]'"` as an exact
 * substring, which made the test the reason the arbitrary spelling survived:
 * `z-30` and `z-[30]` are the same value written two ways, and the guard
 * enforced the minority one. Every z-index in the tree is written as a bare
 * number now, and `tokenDiscipline.test.ts` holds that for the whole tree
 * rather than for the two files this one happens to read.
 *
 * What is asserted here is the relationship — a forward connector sits under
 * the cells, a back connector sits over them, and the two renderers agree with
 * each other — read out of the source rather than matched character for
 * character, so a reformat cannot break it and a reordered declaration cannot
 * hide behind it.
 *
 * These are still structural, not behavioural, and #57 left them that way on
 * purpose. Painting order is not a fact any assertion in this process can
 * reach: jsdom does not build stacking contexts, and the z bands are Tailwind
 * classes that no stylesheet compiles here, so `getComputedStyle` answers
 * nothing about either. What #57 replaced instead were the guards where
 * behaviour WAS reachable — the touch claim and the write-failure paths, both
 * of which now dispatch real events. Regressions in this file are caught by
 * looking at the board.
