/**
 * A placement's identity, and its removal (#277).
 *
 * A placement names its touchpoint one of two ways: a registry id, or a
 * name the registry lacks. "Link to registry" is the first replacing the
 * second, and its inverse is the second replacing the first — the same
 * function both ways, which is why the inverse is the function itself with
 * the pair it returned. Removing a name-only row nobody wants hands back the
 * row and its resources, and `restore_placement` puts both back under the
 * same id.
 *
 * Nothing here matches a name to the registry entry it resembles. That was
 * what made 57 details unreachable; the choice is the author's, made in the
 * panel, and this module only records it.
