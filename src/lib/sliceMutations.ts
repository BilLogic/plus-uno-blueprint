 * renames nobody raced, because an unrelated write bumps `updated_at` without
 * touching a field the form shows. Sending the freshest stamp the client has
 * seen fails nothing at all: by the time someone else's rename has been
 * refetched, it is the token, and the guard waves the overwrite through. Both
 * were shipped in turn, and neither is visible at the call site — only the

 * back here, at submit, and matched against what the form was seeded from: a
 * row whose meta still says what the user was looking at is safe to write, at
 * whatever stamp it now carries, and a row whose meta has moved is a conflict
 * however recently this client learned of it. A missing row is a conflict too
 * — deleted, or hidden by RLS, which is the same ambiguity a zero-row guarded
 * update leaves and the same "reopen it" the caller prints for it.
 *
 * The freshly read stamp still goes to `updateSliceMeta` as the token, so the

 *    returns `error: null` when nothing matched, so removing the image from a
 *    frame that had been merged away reported success and cleared nothing.
 *
 * The inverse is this same function with the previous value, which makes it
