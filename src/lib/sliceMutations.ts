 * trail than an empty array.
 *
 * **The prior rows are read before the delete and carried as the inverse.**
 * This is the most destructive write in the file — it removes every slide of
 * a slice — and it is reachable both from the editor's Save and from the
 * agent's `replace_slides` tool. Without the capture there was no ledger
 * row, no revert control, and nothing counted against the destructive-save
 * gate: an agent told to "reorder the slides" could empty a slice and the

 * whose own inverse already takes the slides with it, and the revert path,
 * which must not log its own undo.
 *
 * **The authored image set travels with the draft's id.** A slide whose author
 * has picked its images keeps that set across a Save that did not touch it,
 * minus any cell the Save stopped citing; an untouched slide stays untouched
 * and stores nothing. A draft with no matching row is new and shows every cell
 * it cites. The prior rows are read once and serve both purposes — the
 * inverse and the carry-forward — so the capture cannot describe a different
 * moment from the write.

 * those URLs and `restore_slides` writes them back verbatim, so deleting the
