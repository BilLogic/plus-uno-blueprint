 * production it never wrote `ref` once, which is what makes zero rows a fact
 * about the field rather than about the surface offering it. The tools carry
 * `note` now, and the descriptions stop calling it a quoted passage: a model
 * reads the description as the field's definition, so "the quoted passage that
 * carries the claim" is an instruction not to write an observation there.
