 * RANKED retrieval over a deployment's own `search_blueprint` function — for

 *
 * ── WHY THIS TOOL IS NOT ALWAYS THERE ─────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every other read in this template goes through PostgREST against tables the
 * template's own schema defines, so it works wherever the template does. This
 * one calls a FUNCTION the template's schema does not carry. A deployment that
 * has built ranked search says so on its config (`agent.search.enabled`), and
 * only then is the tool on the agent's roster — `searchPlan.ts` owns that
 * decision and the reasoning behind its three states. Switched off, the tool
 * is ABSENT rather than present and raising `relation does not exist`.
 *
 * ── WHY THE GENERATED TYPES DO NOT KNOW THE FUNCTION ──────────────────────
 *
 * `types/database.ts` is generated from this repository's migration chain, and
 * `search_blueprint` is not in it — a hand-added entry inside the generated
 * block would be dropped by the next `npm run supabase:types`, and the file's
 * own header only promises to preserve the alias section at the bottom. So the
 * call goes through one narrow local signature instead. The cast is confined
 * to {@link searchRpc}: nothing else in this module is loosely typed, and the
 * contract it asserts is written down in the connector doc a deployment reads.

 * Keep only the rows under the scoped service's phases.

 * takes no service filter, so this narrows its output here instead — meaning
 * results are held to the same scope as every other read. `all`, which
 * includes every single-service deployment, passes straight through.
 *
 * ── WHY A NAME IS NOT ENOUGH, AND WHAT IS DONE ABOUT IT ───────────────────
 *
 * The rows carry a phase NAME, not a phase id, and `phases.name` is not
 * unique across services: two services may each own an "Intake". Placing a
 * row by name alone would hand service A a row belonging to service B, which
 * is the one thing a scoped read must never do. So a name owned by more than
 * one service places nothing — those rows are dropped and COUNTED, and the
 * text says so, because silently dropping them would read as "nothing
 * matched". Narrowing with `phase` or `scenario` is the way out for a caller
 * who hits it.
 *
 * A row with no phase name cannot be placed either, for the same reason. The
 * contract doc requires every row to carry its phase breadcrumb — including a
 * phase's own row, which names itself — precisely so this is reachable only
 * by a deployment whose function breaks that promise.
