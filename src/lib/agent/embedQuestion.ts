/**
 * Turn a person's search question into a vector, with the person's OWN key.
 *
 * ── WHY THE KEY IS THE PERSON'S ───────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Meaning search needs two vectors in one space: the question, and every cell
 * already in the index. Those cannot come from one key, and this module only
 * ever does the first. The deployment's own bot, with a server-held
 * credential, embeds the cells; the template holds no such credential, builds
 * no index, and has no server to run one on. What it has is the key the person
 * is already chatting with, kept in their browser and sent to nobody but their
 * own provider — so the question's half of the pair is the half this code can
 * honestly do.
 *
 * The consequence is a hard constraint, not a preference: the model and the
 * size used here MUST be the ones the deployment's index was built with, which
 * is why every call takes an {@link AgentSearchIndex} entry rather than a model
 * name chosen locally. Mixing spaces does not degrade ranking gracefully — the
 * database is expected to raise `embedding model mismatch`.
 *
 * ── WHAT NEVER HAPPENS TO THE KEY ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * It goes to the provider's own embedding endpoint and nowhere else: not to
 * the blueprint's database, not to the deployment, not into a log line, not
 * into the transcript, and not into a URL. Google's chat transport puts its
 * key in `?key=`, and this deliberately does NOT copy that: a query string is
 * carried in browser history, in proxy logs and in `Referer` headers, so the
 * key rides in `x-goog-api-key` instead. Changing that is a privacy
 * regression, and `embedQuestion.test.ts` fails if a key ever reaches a URL.
 *
 * ── EVERY FAILURE HERE IS AN EmbedQuestionError ────────────────────────────
 *
 * One exception type, thrown for every way this can fail — a rate limit, an
 * outage, a blocked host, a body that is not JSON, a vector of the wrong
 * width, a stall. That is not tidiness: the caller distinguishes "the meaning
 * arm could not run" (fall back to words and structure) from "the search
 * broke" (surface it), and the difference is THIS type. A `TypeError` escaping
 * from `fetch` because the person is offline would be read as the second and
 * would turn a bad connection into an empty blueprint.
 *
 * A caller's own abort is the one thing that passes through untouched: the
 * person pressed Stop, and a keyword search running after that is work nobody
 * asked for.
