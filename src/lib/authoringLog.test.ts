/**
 * The durable half of the record (#176).
 *
 * What is asserted here is the crossing, not the array — `authoring-session`
 * already covers the list. Every test below is a way the log could go on
 * looking correct while having lost the thing it exists to keep: the change
 * itself, the agent that made it, or the payload behind a delete.
 *
 * A green suite is not evidence on its own; a writer that was never installed
 * would also record nothing and also pass a test that only checked the array.
 * So the first test asserts the append HAPPENS, and the rest assert what it
 * carries.
