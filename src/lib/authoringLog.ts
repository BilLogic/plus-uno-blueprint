/**
 * The durable half of the change record.
 *
 * `authoringSession.ts` is the fast one: a module-level array, read by the
 * changes sheet, emptied by a page refresh. That is the right shape for undo
 * and the wrong shape for a record — close the tab and thirty edits leave no
 * trace, while a single deleted cell is remembered forever, because deletions
 * were durable and nothing else was (#176).
 *
 * This module is the other end of `recordChange`: the same entry, appended to
 * `public.authoring_changes`. The two are not alternatives. The array stays
 * the undo affordance and this stays the record, and the reason they can
 * coexist is that neither can drift from the other — both are fed by the one
 * `recordChange` call, after the write it describes has already succeeded.
 *
 * AUDIT-ONLY. Nothing here replays an inverse. `revert` travels so a row can
 * SAY what would undo it; replaying it against a database that has moved on is
 * a different problem and #172 puts it out of scope.

 * The operations whose log row is written by the DATABASE, not by this client.
 *
 * Each of these is a `security definer` function that archives every row it is
 * about to destroy — into the log now, into `deleted_structure` before
 * 20260830200000 folded that table in. It has to: the payload can only be
 * captured inside the same transaction as the cascade, and a client-side
 * append runs afterwards, when the rows it was meant to preserve are gone.
 *
 * So appending here as well would put TWO rows in the log for one delete, one
 * of them without the payload — which is worse than the split this whole
 * change exists to end, because both rows would look like records of the same
 * event and only one of them could restore anything.
 *
 * `remove_lanes` is in the set and is not a `WriteFn`: it is reachable only as
 * the captured inverse of `add_lane`, so `recordChange` never sees it. It is
 * listed because this set's contract is "the SQL functions that archive", and
 * `scripts/tests/authoring-log.test.mjs` holds it to exactly that set read out
 * of the migrations — a seventh archiving function added without a line here
 * fails that test rather than silently double-recording.
