/**
 * The service route — the one module that owns how a service slug lives in the
 * URL path.
 *
 * The app routes by service slug (#335): the first path segment names the
 * active service (`/plus-tutoring`), and the view query params
 * (`urlViewState.ts` — `?cell=`, `?slice=`, …) ride alongside it. The two are
 * orthogonal: this module reads and writes the PATH, `urlViewState` reads and
 * writes the SEARCH, so a deep link like `/plus-tutoring?cell=<id>` carries
 * both the service and the cell.
 *
 * Deliberately hand-rolled, no router dependency — it mirrors how
 * `urlViewState`/`viewStateStore` already own the URL by hand, and keeps the
 * single-service path (its slug in the path, nothing else changed) identical to
 * how the app writes URLs today via `history.replaceState`.
