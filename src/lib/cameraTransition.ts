/**
 * Interpolate the visible world CENTRE linearly and the scale GEOMETRICALLY,

 * moves away before arriving — and the perceived rate of zoom is constant.
 *
 * The geometric half is the part that matters, and it is not a refinement.
 * This used to interpolate the visible rectangle's WIDTH linearly and derive
 * `zoom = viewportWidth / width`. Zoom is the RECIPROCAL of width, so a
 * straight line in width is a hyperbola in zoom, and the visible rate of
 * change is wildly uneven at both ends of it. Measured on a real zoom-out
 * (0.157 → 0.051 over 455 ms): 78% of the perceived travel was over by the
 * halfway frame and 98% by 74% of the duration, leaving the last quarter of
 * the animation to deliver 2% of the visible change. What that looks like is
 * the camera flying past the destination and then hanging — the "overshoot
 * and settle back" it was reported as. Zooming IN is the same defect
 * mirrored: almost nothing happens, then it rushes at the end.
 *
 * Scale is perceived as a ratio, so equal time must buy an equal RATIO of
 * change: `z(t) = z0 · (z1/z0)^t`. That makes the ease curve mean what it
 * says — the eased progress IS the perceived progress — and it makes the
 * two directions symmetric, which linear width can never be.
 *
 * The centre (not the top-left corner) is the anchor: with the scale moving
 * geometrically, interpolating an edge would let the frame drift sideways
 * on its way, because the distance from edge to centre is itself scaling.
