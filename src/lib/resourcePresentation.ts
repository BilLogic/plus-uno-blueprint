/**
 * How a resource is SHOWN, read from its url at render — never stored.
 *
 * Two pure maps. A link's host decides the verb on its button ("Open in
 * Figma", "Watch on YouTube") and the glyph beside it; an attachment's
 * extension decides whether the preview is an image, a video, audio or a
 * document card. Both have a default, because a map that refuses an unknown
 * host is a button that goes missing the day someone links a new tool.
 *
 * Stored nowhere on purpose (#272). A `host` column would be a second copy
 * of the url's own host, wrong the moment the url is edited; and "what kind
 * of file is this" is a property of the bytes at the other end, which the
 * url already names. The one Figma special case the panel carried —
 * `isFigmaUrl`, so that only a Figma link could be "the design" — retires
 * with this file: a placement's link is a featured resource now, and every
 * featured link gets a button, whatever it points at.
