 * the edit INSERTS a second row and leaves the first behind, drawn. Only the
 * note edits in place through it. Measured on 2026-09-09 against a from-scratch
 * replay — one edge, then 1, 2 and 3 rows — and the migration's header carries
 * the numbers.
 *
 * A client-side clear-then-set is not the answer either — two transactions, so
 * a failure between them destroys the edge, and two ledger rows whose undo only
 * half works.
 *
 * Returns the row as it stood, which is what `deriveRevert` above turns into an
 * inverse keyed on the row's own id.
