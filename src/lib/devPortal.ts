/**
 * Developer portal — a CLIENT-SIDE tier simulator.
 *
 * Someone building on this kit has to see both tiers: the ADMIN surfaces
 * (Design mode, handles, panel editors, the agent's write tools) and the
 * REGULAR surfaces the same screens collapse to. Today that costs a second
 * account and a sign-out/sign-in round trip per look. This lets one session
 * pretend to be either.
 *
 * The model is a simulation that is on or off, plus which tier it plays when
 * it is on. "Use my real session" is not a third tier — it is the simulation
 * being off — so the tier choice never sits in a row next to the truth as if
 * it were a peer of it.
 *
 * What it changes: `canWrite` and `canAgentWrite` — the two flags the UI
 * gates authoring on. That is the whole reach.
 *
 * Where it exists: development builds, and nowhere else. The reach above is
 * the client's BELIEF about the session, and a deployed site that lets a
 * stranger move it hands them the entire authoring surface, every control of
 * which then fails against the database. `devPortalEnabled` is that boundary
 * and `useDevSimulation` is where it is applied — one seam, above both the
 * flags and the two controls, so hiding the controls is never what is
 * standing between a stored value and a lifted flag.
 *
 * What it CANNOT change: anything server-side. RLS's restrictive policies
 * and the RPC grants never see this value; they are not consulted by it and
 * they do not consult it. Simulating ADMIN on an account with no rights
 * shows the editing UI and every save then fails with the database's own
 * error — which is the enforcement working, and is said in the portal's
 * tooltips rather than left to be discovered.
