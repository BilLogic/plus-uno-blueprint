/*
 * The canvas owns every gesture inside the board.
 *
 * `touch-action` is NOT inherited, and the board hangs inside
 * `[data-zoom-pan-content]`, which carries a transform and is therefore a
 * composited lane. WebKit does not reliably resolve an ancestor's `none`
 * across that boundary — so with the rule set on the viewport alone, a
 * finger on a cell was taken as a native pan/zoom, which cancels the pointer
 * stream the canvas listens to. Panning and pinching worked on empty canvas
 * and did nothing at all inside a path board.
 *
 * Chromium walks the ancestor chain correctly, so no amount of checking in a
 * Chromium browser pane can catch a regression here. That is exactly why
 * this is pinned in a test instead: the rule looks redundant to anyone
 * reading the stylesheet in a browser where it is.

      multi-touch synthesizes no click and is where WebKit's page pinch-zoom
      starts, which `touch-action` cannot reach at all.
