/**
 * A cell's resources, resolved from whichever source the board came from.

 * points at, carrying its own name, url, kind and order. That was a jsonb
 * array on `cells` called `links`, which held resources and touchpoint prose
 * at once under a name that described one of them.
 *
 * The generated fallback blueprints in `src/data` carry the same two lists a
 * database read produces, so a no-database build serves what a database build
 * serves. `cellTouchpoints.ts` is the sibling for the other half of the array
 * that used to hold both.
