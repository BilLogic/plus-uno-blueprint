 * something the picking had already decided: cells sharing one step column are
 * a step slice, and choosing "lane" for them does not make them one — it only
 * files them somewhere they will not be found. The type steers the sidebar
 * group and nothing else, so a wrong answer is a lost slice, and there is no
 * question here a person can answer better than the geometry can.
 *
 * Read from the DOM rather than from the blueprint model because that is where
 * position already lives: every cell renders with its step and lane on it, and
 * a second source for the same fact is a second thing that can disagree.
