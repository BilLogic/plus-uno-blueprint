/**
 * The dividers, and the one thing they must never read.
 *
 * `lanes.name` is documented as free-form in any language. For as long as the
 * internal interaction line was decided by matching that name against the
 * string `'Support Actions'`, renaming or translating a lane deleted a
 * divider from the board, silently — and 36 of the 40 support lanes in
 * production carried no role at all, so the match was doing the whole job.
 *
 * Every case below is stated twice: once for the role, and once for the same
 * lane wearing a name nobody thought of. The second half is the point. A
 * divider suite that only ever passes English lane names cannot tell a role
 * lookup from a string comparison, which is how this survived.
