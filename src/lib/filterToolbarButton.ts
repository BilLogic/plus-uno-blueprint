/**
 * Shared hover/active styling for view and path filter toolbar buttons.
 *
 * Both states take `border-muted`, the named rung. They used to be
 * `border-border/60` and `border-border/50` — two hand-tuned alphas, 4.88% and
 * 4.06%, standing 0.8 of a percentage point apart and carrying the whole
 * checked/unchecked distinction between them. `--border-muted` is tuned to
 * land on the `/60` alpha exactly (`semantic.css:319`), so the checked edge is
 * pixel-identical and the unchecked one moves by less than a percent of
 * opacity. The state is legible from the plate, the shadow and the ring, none
 * of which is a rounding error.
 *
 * This file is why the raw-value guard now reads `src/lib/` as well as
 * `src/components/`: it carried the exact patterns that guard forbids, in the
 * one directory it did not look at.
