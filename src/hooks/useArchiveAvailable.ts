/**
 * Whether the recovery archive exists in this database.
 *
 * The plan's ordering rule is that no delete affordance ships before its
 * archive does, and this is what makes that rule true at runtime rather than
 * only in the tests. The app is deployed against more than one database — a
 * schema that has not had the authoring migration applied has no recovery
 * archive at all, and a delete there would destroy imported blueprint content
 * with nothing behind it.
 *
 * The subject is `public.trash` since 20260830200000 (#176). It is a VIEW now,
 * over the deletions in `public.authoring_changes`, rather than the
 * `deleted_structure` table it replaced — one log for every authoring write,
 * with the recovery list as a filter on it. The probe is unchanged in
 * everything except the relation it names, because a view answers the only
 * question this hook asks in exactly the same way a table did.
 *
 * The probe is a read, not a catalog lookup: PostgREST answers for the schema
 * it is actually serving, which is the thing that matters. An empty result
 * means the table is there and holds nothing, which is availability; only an
 * error means it is absent. Row-level security can hide the rows but not the
 * relation, so a policy that returns nothing still reads as available — which
 * is right, because the RPCs write through `security definer` regardless.
 *
 * No-DB mode answers `false` through the fallback. There is nothing to delete
 * from and nowhere to put it back.
