 * One cell, from the board that is already in memory.

 * Replaces `useCellSpec` and `useCellContent`, which each fetched a handful of
 * columns for one cell on panel open — up to three round-trips per cell, for
 * fields the board can carry for 2% more payload. See
 * docs/plans/2026-08-21-001-refactor-skeleton-loading-fidelity-plan.md.
 *
 * Synchronous by construction: there is nothing to wait for, which is why the
 * two skeletons those hooks needed are gone rather than reshaped.
