/**
 * What the service read asks for depends on who is asking (#442).
 *
 * `business_models` is deliberately outside the contract's `publicReadTables`
 * — funding, pricing and delivery cost are not world-readable — and `anon`
 * holds no SELECT on it. PostgREST refuses the WHOLE select when one names a
 * table the caller cannot read, so the embed this hook used to carry meant
 * every anonymous visitor to production got `permission denied for table
 * business_models` in a banner above the board, and no service at all.
 *
 * The fake client below therefore ENFORCES the grant rather than assuming it:
 * a request that names `business_models` while signed out fails exactly the
 * way the database fails it. That is what makes this a reproduction and not a
 * restatement — against the embedding read, the anonymous case here shows the
 * production banner.
 *
 * The seam is `ServicePanel`, rendered over the real hook, because the claim
 * is about what a reader ends up seeing: a visitor gets the service and no
 * commercial section, an author gets both.
