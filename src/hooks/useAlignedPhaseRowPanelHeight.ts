 * The one height a phase row's panels share, measured rather than predicted.
 *
 * THE ESTIMATE IS A PLACEHOLDER, NOT A FLOOR. It exists to size panels in
 * the commit before anything has been measured; the moment a measurement
 * lands it replaces the estimate outright, in both directions. Treating it
 * as a floor is what put 84px of dead gray under every board on the canvas —
 * measured on all six phase rows, the same 84px on each, because a constant
 * error in the prediction can never be corrected by a `Math.max` that only
 * ever rounds up. Two independent terms produced it:
 *
 *   64px  the panel-height estimates asked `getComparePanelScrollPaddingY()`
 *         with no options, so every one of them budgeted for the UNLOCKED
 *         scroll chrome — resize-handle inset plus artboard buffer — on
 *         panels that are height-locked and have no resize handle. This
 *         measuring pass and `ResizableComparePanel` both correctly pass
 *         `{ lockHeight: true }`, so estimate and measurement were never
 *         describing the same panel.
 *   20px  a path-section bottom inset the stacked board does not render.
 *
 * The estimates are threaded with the lock now, so the placeholder is close;
 * but nothing here depends on it being right any more, which is the point.
 * A future drift in any estimate shows up as one wrong pre-paint frame
 * instead of as permanent gray.
 *
 * Both effects are LAYOUT effects. Measurement in a passive effect would let
 * a frame paint at the estimate first, which is the pop this design exists
 * to avoid.
