 * The one height a phase row's panels share, MEASURED rather than predicted.
 *
 * The estimate is a placeholder, not a floor. It exists to size panels in
 * the commit before anything has been measured; the moment a measurement
 * lands it replaces the estimate outright, in BOTH directions. Held as a
 * floor — `Math.max(estimate, measured)` — a prediction that runs hot can
 * never be corrected, because the max only ever rounds up: the surplus
 * paints as dead gray under every board and no amount of measuring removes
 * it. The estimates are threaded with the panel's real scroll chrome now,
 * so the placeholder is close; but nothing here depends on it being right
 * any more, which is the point. A future drift costs one wrong pre-paint
 * frame instead of permanent gray.
 *
 * An EXCLUDED panel is measured into its own bucket rather than skipped.
 * Skipping it is what the row height needs; but the panel still has to be
 * given a height, and the only number left for it would be the row's — which
 * was computed without it, and is therefore short exactly when it is the
 * tallest thing in the row. See `resolveScenarioPanelHeight`.
 *
 * Both effects are LAYOUT effects. Measuring in a passive effect would let a
 * frame paint at the estimate first, which is the pop this design exists to
 * avoid.
