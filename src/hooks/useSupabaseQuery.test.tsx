/**
 * The read lifetime, asserted through the hook that owns it.
 *
 * `readLifetime.test.ts` covers the pieces — the deadline and the retry
 * policy. This file covers the thing those pieces were assembled for: a read
 * whose consumer has gone away is CANCELLED, not merely ignored. That the
 * fetcher is handed an `AbortSignal` is a fact the type already states and no
 * test needs to repeat; that abandoning the read ENDS it is behaviour, and it
 * is what these cases fail on.
 *
 * Every fetcher here answers only when it is cancelled, which is the shape of
 * the slow request the feature exists for. Against a wrapper that hands the
 * fetcher no signal, they never answer at all — so a regression reads as "the
 * abandoned read was never cancelled" rather than as a type error somewhere
 * further up.
