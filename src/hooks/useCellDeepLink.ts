 * `?cell=<id>` — open the blueprint on one cell, panel showing.
 *
 * This is the receiving end of the share link: uno-bot cites a cell in Slack
 * or the IDE and attaches this URL, so the reader lands on the thing that was
 * quoted instead of on the homepage with a cell id to hunt for.
 *
 * Three steps, because a cell id alone is not a place: resolve the cell to its
 * scenario, seed the base view there, then open the panel by driving the SAME
 * ⌘-click gesture the agent's `open_cell_panel` uses — one open path, no
 * parallel implementation to drift from the click grammar.
 *
 * `seedBaseSelection` (not `selectScenario`) is deliberate: it no-ops once the
 * user has navigated, so a slow resolve cannot yank someone away from a place
 * they chose while the query was in flight.
