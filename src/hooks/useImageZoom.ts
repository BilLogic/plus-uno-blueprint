 *

 * artboards, focus cells, an annotation layer, agent commands and a

 * a change to image zoom could regress the board. What IS shared is the
 * arithmetic underneath, through the reducer's own imports.
 *
 * Nodes are held in state rather than in refs. The popup mounts when the
 * dialog opens, so an effect that read a ref once, at a moment the popup did
 * not exist, would attach its wheel listener to nothing and never retry.
