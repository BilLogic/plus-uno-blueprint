/**
 * One shared query state machine for read hooks (thin hooks like `useSlices`
 * wrap it). `key` identifies the request: results are cached by key and shared
 * across mounts, the fetcher re-runs when the key changes, and stale responses
 * are dropped. Pass `key: null` to gate the query — nothing runs and the result
 * stays `loading` (e.g. while a parent query resolves). `fetcher` is read
 * through a ref, so inline closures are fine — it is re-evaluated per key, not
 * per identity. `fallback` must be referentially stable (wrap it in
 * `useCallback`): the no-DB and error results are memoized on its identity.
 *
 * No-DB mode (client null) resolves synchronously from `fallback()`:
 * `ready`/`'fallback'` when it returns data, `error` when it returns null.
 * Database errors and timeouts surface as `error` with `fallback` populated.
 *
 * `fetcher` is handed the query's abort signal alongside the client and must
 * pass it to the request (`.abortSignal(signal)`): that is what makes leaving
 * a view, or changing its key, stop the read it started.
 *
 * The caching, dedupe and invalidation underneath are TanStack Query's; this
 * wrapper exists so callers keep a single discriminated union to switch on
 * instead of the `isPending`/`isError`/`data` triple, and so the no-DB branch —
 * which has no request to make and must not enter the cache at all — stays
 * outside the query.
