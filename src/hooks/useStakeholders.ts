 * suggest from whatever strings happened to be in the data reads this instead,
 * so "tutor" and "Regular Tutor" stop being two people.
 *
 * The read is deliberately unscoped, and under the shared catalog (ADR 0014)
 * that is now CORRECT rather than a latent bug: the stakeholder pool is the
 * deployment's, so a lane in any service picks from one cast.
