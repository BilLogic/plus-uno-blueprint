/**
 * Moving between scenarios collapses a multi-path comparison back to the
 * happy-path default.
 *
 * Path selection is identity-keyed and global, so a comparison built inside
 * one scenario (three paths, Merged view) used to follow the reader into the
 * next scenario — which then opened as a comparison nobody asked for there.
 * The comparison was a statement about the scenario it was built in, not a
 * standing preference.
 *
 * Only a scenario-to-scenario move resets. Entering the first scenario from
 * the overview keeps whatever filter was set there — an overview selection
 * is a filter, and focusing is not a reason to lose it — and a deep-link
 * seed lands as a first entry (null → id) for the same reason. The collapse
 * is a no-op when the selection already equals the default, so ordinary
 * happy-path navigation never churns downstream state.
 *
 * A bridge component rather than logic inside PathSelectionProvider: the
 * provider module stays free of EditorContext (whose module graph reaches
 * the Supabase client), which keeps the pure selection helpers importable
 * from node-environment tests.
