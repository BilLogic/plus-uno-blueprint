/**
 * The app's one wrapper for "this button is only an icon, so it has to say
 * what it does".
 *
 * Before this there were five local re-implementations of the identical four
 * lines (`RailButton`, `ToolButton`, `StrokeWeightButton`,
 * `ShapeToolbarTooltip`, the sidebar's row action) and roughly fifty icon
 * buttons with no tooltip at all — a dozen of them making do with a native
 * `title`, which arrives after a second, in the browser's font, and cannot be
 * styled or positioned.
 *
 * Two rules, both non-optional:
 *
 * 1. **The child keeps its own `aria-label`.** A tooltip is not an accessible
 *    name — it is not read by a screen reader in place of one, and it never
 *    appears for a keyboard user who has not hovered. This wrapper adds the
 *    sighted-mouse half of the affordance; the label is the other half and
 *    stays on the button.
 * 2. **Say what it does, not what it is.** "Start a new session", not
 *    "Plus". The existing copy sets the register: "New scenario in
 *    Post-session", "Fold 4 shared steps", "kept expanded — feeds a divergent
 *    step".
 *
 * No `TooltipProvider` is needed — one is mounted app-wide in `App.tsx` at a
 * 200 ms delay. Wrap in a local provider only to change that delay, the way
 * the annotation toolbar deliberately slows its View/Edit switch down.
