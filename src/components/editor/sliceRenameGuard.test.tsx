/**
 * What the rename dialog's concurrency guard actually does, driven rather
 * than read.
 *
 * The guard has now been wrong in both directions. It first sent the stamp
 * captured when the context menu opened, so a refetch in between failed a
 * rename nobody had raced (#114). The fix sent the freshest stamp the client
 * held instead — which passes the guard precisely when somebody else's rename
 * has already been refetched into the list, and overwrites them (#128). Both
 * failures are invisible in the source: the call reads the same either way,
 * and only the *value* of the token differs.
 *
 * So the two directions are stood up as one pair, against a fake `slices`
 * table whose update bumps `updated_at` the way the real trigger does. Without
 * that bump no token could ever go stale and the whole file would be vacuous.
 *
 * The dialog is rendered directly and its `slice` prop is swapped between the
 * seed and the submit. That swap used to matter: the sidebar resolved the row
 * from the live list on every render, so a refetch reached straight into the
 * open dialog. This change deletes that resolution and freezes the seed at
 * open, so the swap is now expected to change nothing — which is exactly what
 * these rerenders assert, and why they stay.
