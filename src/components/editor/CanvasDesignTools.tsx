 * The Edit tool run.
 *
 * Edit and View own separate tool runs — that is what makes them two modes
 * rather than one mode with a flag. View reads, navigates and marks up; Edit
 * authors. Annotation tools deliberately do not appear here: a pen active
 * while cells are selectable is a click with two meanings, and the mode switch
 * exists precisely so that question has one answer at a time.
 *
 * What used to be here and is not any more, each moved somewhere that knows
 * more than a global bar does:
 *
 * - **Edit cell** → gone. Picking one cell opens the panel, which is what
 *   clicking a cell always did.
 * - **New scenario** → the phase row's `+` in the sidebar, so the phase is
 *   chosen by the row rather than by a picker that can disagree with it.
 * - **New path** → the PATHS header's `+`, scoped to the selected scenario.
 * - **New step / lane / cell** → handles on the grid, because a position
 *   cannot be supplied by a menu.
 *
 * What stays is what acts on the *selection*, which has no home on the canvas:
 * making a slice from it, and clearing it.
 *
 * **Delete path** has now gone too, to the path's own row menu in the sidebar.
 * A destructive button sitting beside "Make slice" is a misclick waiting to
 * happen, and a global one also has to guess which path it means — a row
 * cannot be wrong about that.

    slice" there reads as an invitation to make a slice out of a slice,
