/**
 * Admin sign-in, then the agent's provider / model / key — the whole of
 * the settings surface, with no opinion about what frames it.
 *
 * Two frames use it: the desktop rail's ⚙ popover, and the phone drawer's
 * settings surface. It lives apart from both because the phone had NO way
 * to sign in at all before (the gear is desktop rail chrome), which on a
 * deployed site meant a phone could never reach the agent — and a second
 * copy of an auth form is how two sign-in flows drift apart.
 *
 * The two halves are their own components because they share nothing: no
 * state crosses between them and each reads only the context field it
 * needs. What is left here is what genuinely spans both — the column they
 * sit in, the section headings, the rule between them, and the `canAgent`
 * gate that decides whether the second half exists at all.
 *
 * That gate is `canAgent` and NOT `canWrite`: a regular creator and an admin
 * see the same provider, model and key rows. The agent is a reading tool, the
 * key is the creator's own, and tier gates writing rather than asking — the
 * write half of the line is `canAgentWrite`, which the agent panel reads and
 * this surface does not. `SupabaseProvider`'s `canAgent` carries the whole
 * reasoning; a tier check added here fails a test that names the decision.
 *
 * `active` is only the model-list fetch gate: skip the provider round-trip
 * while the surface is closed.
