  One mode for the whole session, module-level.

  This began as per-surface state ("editing a slice while reading the base
  blueprint is a normal thing to want") and lost to how it actually feels:
  flipping to Edit, opening a slice tab, and landing back in View reads as
  the switch not having taken. Mode is the person's posture, not the
  surface's — it follows them across tabs. Deliberately not in the URL: a
  shared link should open in View whatever the sender was doing.
