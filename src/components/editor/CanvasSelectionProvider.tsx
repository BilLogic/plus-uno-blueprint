/**
 * The Design-mode selection.
 *
 * Selection is an **ordered list**, not a set, because a slice made from it is
 * ordered. Individual clicks append in click order — picking a journey by hand
 * keeps the order you walked it — while bulk gestures (lane, column, marquee)
 * append in grid reading order, which their callers supply.
 *
 * The grammar used to be Figma's — plain click replaces, shift toggles — on the
 * reasoning that it is the vocabulary most people already have in their hands.
 * That was wrong, and the symptom was that a slice could not be built by
 * clicking: every click threw the previous one away, so the only way to gather
 * four cells was to hold shift for three of them, which nothing said.
 *
 * Figma's grammar fits a selection that is **the subject of the next verb**,
 * where verbs are frequent and each one acts on whatever is currently held.
 * This selection is **a set being assembled**, and there is exactly one verb at
 * the end: make a slice. So the grammar here is a file list's, not a canvas
 * editor's — click gathers, shift reaches, Escape clears.
 *
 * The full table of what each modifier means, and every place it departs from
 * Figma, is in `cellPickGrammar` — one file, so no two gestures can disagree.
 *
 * Editing a single cell is not lost to this: double-click, or right-click →
 * View cell detail. Both leave the selection exactly as it was.

   * being edited. Once a click started gathering that stopped being true —
   * every first cell of a slice threw a panel across the canvas you were
   * picking from, and the panel is 320px of the thing you are trying to read.
   *
   * Opening it is now deliberate, and has two gestures of its own:
   * double-click and right-click → *View cell detail*. Both leave the
   * selection exactly as it was, which is the whole point — you can read a
   * cell you are still deciding about.
   *
   * What remains here is only the *closing* half: once two or more cells are
   * picked, a panel describing one of them is describing the wrong thing.
   *
   * The detail context is read through a **ref**, not a dependency. Its value
   * is a fresh object on every render of its provider, and selecting a cell
   * re-renders that provider — so depending on it directly re-runs this
   * effect, which selects again, which re-renders. That is not a subtle risk;
   * it is an immediate "Maximum update depth exceeded".

    cells re-rendered from scratch (~700ms jam, read as "loading is
    broken"), and every annotation — held in plain useState inside the
