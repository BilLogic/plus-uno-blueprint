/**
 * The cover page — the shell's landing view.
 *
 * Everything visible is data from a `CoverContent` module; the components
 * here own only layout and theme treatment. Tab state is local and
 * unserialized: `?slice=` deep links resolve one way, out of this page into
 * app surfaces, never into a cover tab (plan §4.4 — a second writer on the
 * query string would race the slice resolution).
 *
 * The header's button is the page's only NAVIGATING action — the one way
 * to leave the cover. Figures are click-to-expand, which is a second class
 * of button, deliberately: it never writes, fetches, or navigates, so the
 * page stays identical for a read-only visitor and in a zero-config
 * workspace whether or not a reader ever opens one.

          before the reader had been told what they were opening, and left
          it stranded in whitespace beside a one-line title. Reading order
          and visual order now agree: what this is, what it does, how to
          enter. It also stops the action jumping position between a short
          title and a long one.
