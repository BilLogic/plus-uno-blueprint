 * The owner pair, read-only.

 * set — side by side, because the interesting case is when they differ. That
 * gap is a finding: the person on the other side thinks they are dealing with
 * someone other than whoever is accountable.
 *
 * Editing does not live here anymore: in Edit mode the panel swaps this
 * section for `CellPanelEditor`, one form with one Save for the whole cell.
