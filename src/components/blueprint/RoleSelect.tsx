 *
 * The unmarked option is FIRST and is a real choice rather than a placeholder.
 * A select whose empty state is an unselectable prompt teaches that
 * something is missing; here nothing is missing — most placements will never
 * be judged, and the author has to be able to go back to that state after
 * marking one by mistake. Its label says "nobody has judged this" so that
 * choosing it is not choosing a third degree of importance.
