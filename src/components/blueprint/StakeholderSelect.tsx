    Read-only is the OWNER BADGE, not the prose it used to be.

    The name was already here; what was missing was any way to find out who
    that party is. The registry has held a one-line definition of all 18 of
    them since August and no screen selected it — `stakeholders.summary`, and
    it was called `note` until 20260830160000, which is how it stayed
    unreadable long enough to be worth a ticket. Hanging it on the badge is
    the mechanism `docs/reference/panel-affordances.md` names for exactly this
    — a value from a governed vocabulary the reader learns by seeing it repeat,
    whose meaning belongs on its own hover.

    The kind stays beside the badge as text rather than joining it: a badge
    says one thing, and "Regular Tutor" and "Staff" are two.
