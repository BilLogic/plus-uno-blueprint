 * A placeholder that stops matching its panel is invisible in review and
 * obvious to a reader, which is the worst way round.
 *
 * These assert STRUCTURE — how many fields, at what row counts — not pixels.
 * The claim that broke was structural: one placeholder with two equal boxes
 * standing in for a three-textarea panel, a four-field form, an image row and
 * an accordion. Pixel assertions would be brittle and would get skipped, which
 * is how a contract test stops holding anything.
