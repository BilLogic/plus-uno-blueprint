/*
  ONE PATH, ONE COLUMN.

  The picker used to choose a column by filtering the same list against two
  `Set`s of kinds and treating the two results as disjoint. They were not —
  one kind sat in the primary set twice, left there by the fold that retired
  `unhappy` and `alternative` onto kinds already listed. Nothing was in a
  position to catch it: a `Set` absorbs a repeated member instead of failing,
  and two independent membership tests have no overlap for a compiler to look
  at.

  What follows asserts the property that defect violated and nothing narrower.
  It names no kind and no column, and it never says how many kinds there are.
  It reads the vocabulary the app declares, builds every short arrangement of
  it, and checks that grouping is a partition: everything that goes in comes
  back out, exactly once, with nothing invented. A fourth kind would arrive as
  a migration and a decision — it should not also arrive as an edit here.
