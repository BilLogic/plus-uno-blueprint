/**
 * What KIND of thing this bar names, said in a word rather than in a hue.
 *
 * A reader who has never seen a service blueprint cannot tell a scenario bar
 * from a phase bar: both are a bold name over a sentence. The badge says which
 * without being hovered, and carries that kind's definition for the reader who
 * then wants one (#240).
 *
 * NEUTRAL by decision, not by omission. The grid already spends colour on lane
 * role and path kind. The diagram assets do carry a per-entity tint, but those
 * are hardcoded hexes in `docs/assets` with no token behind them, so adopting
 * them would invent a THIRD colour axis rather than reuse either existing one.
 * `outline` is the badge's own neutral variant; the ink drops to
 * `text-muted-foreground` so the word does not compete with the semibold name
 * beside it. Nothing here touches the badge's size — one size for every badge
 * is settled in one place, not per call site.
 *
 * A DEFINITION TRIGGER AND NOTHING ELSE. `EntityTitleAffordance` keeps the
 * panel: it is one target with an `absolute inset-0` opener filling it, so a
 * badge placed inside it would either open the panel on click or have to climb
 * back out on a z-index. Rendering it as the affordance's SIBLING is what makes
 * "the badge does not open the panel" true by construction rather than by a
 * `stopPropagation` somebody can delete.
 *
 * No `cursor-help`: it is on its way out everywhere (#243) along with the
 * dotted cue and the ⓘ, and adding one here only to delete it next is churn.
 *
 * The accessible name is the kind THEN the entity's own name, so a screen
 * reader gets the pairing a sighted reader gets from the two sitting side by
 * side. Kind first, because the visible word has to start the name it is read
 * by for the two to be one label rather than two.

/**
 * The identity block above the canvas: what this thing is called, and what
 * it is.
 *
 * ONE component for three surfaces — the service overview, a phase, a
 * scenario. The same block was written three times, and only one of the three
 * owned a query, which is exactly why only that one was broken (#234). It
 * takes a RESOLVED identity and never a query: the service surface unpacks
 * `useServiceSpec`, the phase and scenario surfaces unpack the props they
 * already hold, and this component never learns which is which.
 *
 * It reserves its height rather than sizing to it — see
 * `BLUEPRINT_MENUBAR_IDENTITY_HEIGHT`, which is where the number and the
 * argument live, because all three bars draw their geometry from that module.
 *
 * The name is followed by a neutral badge naming its KIND — see
 * `EntityKindBadge`. It rides here rather than inside the title affordance
 * because it must not open the panel the affordance opens.
 *
 * FOUR STATES, THREE PICTURES:
 *
 *   loading            the skeleton
 *   ready, an entity   the name and its summary
 *   ready, nothing     a present, empty bar — this deployment has no service
 *   error              a present bar, with the failure in the SUMMARY slot
 *
 * The failure goes in the summary slot and never the title slot. The title is
 * an interactive affordance — it opens the entity panel — so error text there
 * offers a control that leads nowhere.
 *
 * The summary is a row UNDER the title, inside the same block. Inline after a
 * separator it competed with the name for the same line and truncated first on
 * a narrow canvas; outside the block it lost the block's own
 * `max-w-[calc(100%-9rem)]` and `gap-0.5`, so the two lines sat at a different
 * rhythm from the identical bar one level down. `title` and not a tooltip:
 * this is truncated prose, and the full text is one click away in the panel
 * the name opens.
