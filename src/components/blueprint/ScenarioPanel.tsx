            The body freezes a baseline and a per-path form at mount, and the
            paths under a scenario are not fixed while the drawer is open: the
            canvas agent's `create_path` and `duplicate_path` both invalidate
            every query, so this panel refetches and re-renders against a
            scenario carrying a path the form has never heard of. Keyed on the
            id alone the body did not remount, and the first render of the new
            path read `form.paths[id].status` on `undefined` — a TypeError, the
            error boundary, and the whole drawer gone.

            Remounting resets any unsaved edit in the panel, which is the
            deliberate trade: a path list that changed underneath the author is
            a different form, and silently keeping half of it — some rows from
            the old baseline, some from the new — is the worse answer. The
            common case is untouched, because nothing re-keys unless a path is
