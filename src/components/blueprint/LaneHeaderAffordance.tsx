/**
 * The lane's name, what a lane IS, and the way into this one's properties.
 *
 * Three readers, three doors (#306). A pointer reader clicks anywhere on the
 * block — the label included — to open the panel, and rests on it to learn
 * what a lane is; the definition opens on a hover of the WHOLE block, not of
 * one word. A keyboard reader tabs to the opener to open the panel and to the
 * ⓘ to read the definition. A touch reader, who has no hover and whose tap is
 * already the panel's, gets the ⓘ — invisible on a device that hovers, drawn
 * only where hover is not.
 *
 * The z-order bug the label used to hide: the name painted above the opener
 * (`z-10`) and swallowed its own click. `pointer-events-none` on the name lets
 * the click fall through to the opener; the block also carries the open so a
 * click that reaches it (a keyboard activation, a test) opens the panel too.
 * The name stops being a distinct target — it is just the word now.
 *
 * Top-left aligned, because a lane label reads down a tall row — the only
 * thing it does differently from the column header it shares a treatment with.
 *
 * NOT used where the label already means something else. In the compare rail's
 * Design mode the label is a *selection* handle — clicking takes every cell in
 * the lane — and a second meaning on the same word would make both ambiguous.
 * There the ⓘ stays a button of its own, beside it (`EntityPropertiesButton`).
