/**
 * #405 — the board draws a name-only placement dashed, and only on a board
 * that has rows to be name-only in.
 *
 * `blueprintTouchpointCell.test.tsx` already says that the cell honours a
 * `nameOnly` prop; until this ticket no production call site passed one, so
 * that promise reached nothing. These tests render the block the board
 * actually composes and read the DOM, because a rename that typechecks is not
 * evidence that anything is drawn differently.
 *
 * The two cases are the two sources a board can come from, and the second is
 * the one #401's bug would have got wrong:
 *
 *  - a DATABASE board, whose placements are `cell_touchpoints` rows. A row
 *    with a `name` and no `touchpoint_id` is a name-only placement and draws
 *    dashed; its neighbour, joined to a registry entry, draws plainly.
 *  - a FALLBACK board, whose placements `cellTouchpointsFromLinks` mints from
 *    the delimited `content` string. Those carry neither a row id nor a
 *    registry link, and none of them is name-only — a whole lane drawn dashed
 *    is what the wrong predicate would produce here.
