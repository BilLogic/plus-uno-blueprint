/**
 * An ordinary word naming a section, with nothing behind it.
 *
 * `Status`, `Paths`, `Position` — these carried definitions until #244, on the
 * reasoning that a reader who does not know the vocabulary needs help. They
 * are not the vocabulary. A sentence explaining that a field called Status
 * holds a status helps nobody, and eleven of them taught readers that hovering
 * a label is not worth doing — which cost the words that DO need explaining
 * the only affordance they have.
 *
 * The words that need it are badges now, and `PanelTermLabel` is where they
 * live. This is the shape for everything else, and it is deliberately inert:
 * no popover, no focus ring, nothing to reach, because there is nothing there.
