/**
 * The why-line waits for a reader, and asks one row's space to do it in.
 *
 * A dependency row already says WHAT it points at — the lane and the step.
 * The note says WHY the edge exists, which is worth reading one row at a time
 * and not worth reading down a list of eight. Revealed by opacity it still
 * held its line, so a list of eight rows drew sixteen and the list's shape
 * depended on how talkative its author had been. Read from a tooltip, eight
 * rows draw eight.
 *
 * A tooltip is not an accessible name — `IconTooltip` states that rule, and
 * this Base UI version is the proof of it: the popup carries neither
 * `role="tooltip"` nor an `aria-describedby` back to the trigger, and the
 * trigger's hover interaction is `mouseOnly`, so a touch never opens it at
 * all. The sentence therefore stays in the DOM, inside the row's own button,
 * and only a FINE pointer trades the printed line for the popup: a screen
 * reader reads the note as part of the row's name, a touch reader sees it
 * printed where it has always been, and a keyboard reader gets the popup
 * because the same trigger opens on focus as well as on hover.
 *
 * Conditioned on the pointer being fine rather than on its not being coarse,
 * so a device reporting no pointer at all — where nothing hovers and nothing
 * taps — keeps the printed line rather than losing it to a rule about mice.
 *
 * `ROW_REVEAL_CLASS` stays where it is; this file is simply no longer one of
 * its callers. The resource list's drag handle is the other, and opacity is
 * the right rule for a CONTROL, which has to stay where the cursor expects to
 * find it. It was only ever the wrong rule for prose (#549).
