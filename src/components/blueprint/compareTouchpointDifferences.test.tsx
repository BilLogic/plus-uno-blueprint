/**
 * #382 — a compare of two paths that place different touchpoints on the same
 * cell shows the difference.
 *
 * The compare data layer used to weigh three fields: `content`, `summary` and
 * `resources`. A touchpoint lane's cell can carry placements the grid label
 * never names — the author types one touchpoint into the cell and places the
 * rest from the panel — so two paths could hold a visibly different set of
 * touchpoints at the same slot, agree on all three of those fields, and be
 * reported as `shared`. The reader was told the paths were identical there
 * while the board in front of them drew different touchpoints.
 *
 * `touchpoints` is the fourth field, and this file is the evidence that it
 * changed what a reader sees rather than only what the types say. The
 * signature it compares is the placement's name, its summary and its role —
 * what the placement points AT is a resource, and the third field already
 * covers that.
 *
 * Three cases, and the negative one matters as much as the others: a field
 * that reported every slot divergent would pass the first two tests and be
 * worse than no field at all.
 *
 *  - two paths whose placements differ → `divergent`, and `touchpoints` is
 *    the only field named. It is a DETAIL-ONLY difference, so the canvas must
 *    not fork (taxonomy V7) and the ledger's trailing group is where it lives.
 *  - the ledger surface actually draws that group, and the row inside it.
 *  - two paths whose placements match stay `shared`, and the surface says the
 *    paths are identical.
