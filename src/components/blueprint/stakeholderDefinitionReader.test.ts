/**
 * The eighteen stakeholder definitions reach a screen, and keep reaching one.
 *
 * `stakeholders.summary` is populated on every row of the registry and was
 * written by the mutation layer for months while NOTHING selected it for a
 * reader. Renaming it from `note` fixed the word; this file is what stops the
 * column going quiet again, because a column with a writer and no reader
 * produces no error, no empty state and no failing test — it simply does not
 * appear, which is exactly why it went unnoticed.
 *
 * Three links have to hold, and breaking any one of them restores the old
 * silence without breaking anything else:
 *
 *   1. the owner badge puts the kind's meaning and the definition on its
 *      definition card,
 *   2. the stakeholder field renders that badge with the registry's own
 *      summary — and, where the badge is a picker instead, prints the same
 *      sentence,
 *   3. a lane that has a stakeholder and nothing else is not treated as empty,
 *      which is 74 of the 75 lanes that name one.
 *
 * Read as text rather than rendered. The question is which values these
 * components pass to each other, which is a fact about the source; rendering
 * `LanePanel` needs a Supabase client, a canvas-mode provider and a footer
 * host, and would test those three instead.
 *
 * And every assertion is paired with a RED case built by deleting the wiring
 * from a copy of the real source. A check that examined nothing would print
 * the same clean line — the argument `scripts/tests/rls-posture.test.mjs`
 * makes, applied to a reader instead of a policy.
