/**
 * The active service — the one the URL slug names — resolved to its id and
 * name, threaded the way the path selection is: a provider mounted high in the
 * tree, read through a hook.
 *
 * The slug itself lives in a module store (`activeServiceStore`, ADR 0005),
 * because non-React resolvers read it; this provider is the React-side
 * resolution of slug -> service and the one place that CANONICALIZES the URL:
 * once the service is known, its own slug is written to the path, so a
 * single-service deployment that booted at the bare root ends with its slug in
 * the address bar, and a reload lands on the same service.
 *
 * Journey reads do not consume this context — they resolve the id inside their
 * fetchers via `lib/service.ts` so their two reads still go out in the same
 * tick. This context is for surfaces that need the service's identity or the
 * whole roster — the cover's Services tab and the top-strip switcher (#336) —
 * and for the canonicalization effect below.
