/**
 * The service's six per-kind examples, made reachable to every definition
 * popover on the board without threading a prop through the whole grid (#302).
 *
 * A definition popover is the single funnel every board label opens its card
 * through — a kind badge, a path badge, a lane or step header. The example that
 * grounds each kind is per-service (one map for the whole deployment), so it
 * rides a context the popover reads by its own `kind` rather than a value
 * plumbed to a dozen scattered call sites. The service read stays in one place;
 * the popovers stay presentational.
 *
 * The default is a FROZEN empty map, not a throw: a popover rendered outside a
 * provider — a unit test, the path-selector menu — reads `{}` and shows no
 * example, exactly as a fresh deployment does. That is what keeps the popover
 * safe to render anywhere.
