 * The active service's slug, as a module-level fact (ADR 0005).

 * by non-React code: `lib/service.ts` resolves the active service's id inside
 * plain fetcher functions with no hooks, exactly the condition that sends state
 * to a module store rather than context. The slug is seeded from the boot URL
 * path, so a deep link to `/<slug>` and a reload both land on the same service.
 *
 * Deliberately just the slug — the id and name are a database read away
 * (`useActiveService`), and the slug is the only part the URL and the
 * non-React resolvers need to agree on.
