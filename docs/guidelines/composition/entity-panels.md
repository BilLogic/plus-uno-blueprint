# Entity panels

Six subjects — service, phase, scenario, lane, step, cell — over **one shell**.
That is the whole design, and it is worth saying why it is one shell: all of the
chrome was written for the cell panel and lived inside it, and four levels of
the blueprint tree own spec fields while only one had a surface. Copying a
ninety-line drawer four times is how two of them end up with different close
behaviour. `panelShell.tsx` is that drawer, lifted rather than duplicated.

## What the shell owns

`src/components/blueprint/panelShell.tsx` owns posture, keying, the footer host,
the field label, the header, the kind badge, the empty state and the Save/Cancel
row. Two panels sit on it: `EntityDetailPanel` (the five non-cell subjects) and
`BlueprintCellDetailPanel`.

- **Posture** is the drawer/sheet contract, owned by
  [dialogs-sheets-and-forms.md](dialogs-sheets-and-forms.md): a right-pinned
  inspector card on desktop, a bottom sheet below the gate, keyed on posture so
  a resize across the breakpoint remounts clean.
- **`data-cell-detail-panel` keeps its name** even though it is now the shell's
  attribute, not the cell panel's. It is a DOM contract in twenty places —
  every entry/exit animation in `animations.css`, the pan-exempt selector in
  `ServiceOverviewView`, `MarqueeSelection`, `SliceView`, `print.css`. Renaming
  it is a twenty-site change that will present as "the panel stopped animating".
- **One tree position.** Every render branch — details, draft, placeholder,
  differences — returns the shell at the same tree position, so React
  reconciles them as the same drawer. A surface switch is a content swap inside
  an open drawer, never a close-reopen.
- **One footer host per panel.** `CELL_PANEL_FOOTER_ID` and its four siblings
  are global DOM ids a form portals its Save/Cancel row into. Only one panel is
  open at a time today; separate ids make that a design choice rather than the
  only thing standing between us and the lane panel's buttons appearing under
  the cell panel's fields.
- **Exit timing is a timer, not only a callback.** `PANEL_EXIT_MS` must stay ≥
  the exit transition in `animations.css`. The drawer's own
  `onOpenChangeComplete(false)` was measured not to fire; it stays wired, and
  whichever arrives first wins.
- **Save is disabled until something differs** from the frozen baseline, and
  closing is blocked only while a save is in flight (`panelEditorBusy()`, which
  reads `data-panel-editor[data-busy]` — deliberately not a cell-specific
  attribute, or it would have guarded exactly one panel).

**Four states, not three.** Loading and error were there; a lane with no owner,
no KPIs and no tools rendered a full form of blank fields, which reads as a
loaded form the reader has to inspect to discover is empty. `PanelEmpty` is the
fourth — **view mode only**. In edit mode a blank form is correct.

## Loading is shaped, not generic

One generic placeholder stood in for four structurally different panels, and no
panel has two equal full-width boxes, so the swap read as a re-flow rather than
a fill-in. `panelLoading.tsx` exports one placeholder per panel, with heights
derived from the real field count, and counts that are **free**: the step
placeholder reads the frame count off the canvas store, the scenario one counts
the paths already displayed. A request issued to improve a placeholder would
invert the whole point.

`panelLoadingContract.test.ts` pins that structurally: the phase and step
placeholders must carry the same field-row count as their panels, and nothing
may reintroduce a generic `<PanelLoading />`. Change a panel's field count
without touching its placeholder and the suite says so.

## What the six share

Every panel is `PanelHeader` → one scroll region → `PanelFooterHost`, and every
one edits the same way:

- `canEdit` is design mode **and** write capability, never one of them.
- The form's baseline is **frozen at mount** with a `useState` initializer. The
  query keeps tracking the database, and a revert landing mid-edit would
  otherwise let Save write the reverted values straight back.
- The body is keyed by entity id, so switching subjects inside the open drawer
  starts a clean form.
- Save writes only what differs, records one ledger entry **per row that
  moved**, invalidates, and closes. Cancel is close.
- The meta line says only what the canvas cannot. Counts and relationships —
  never a restatement of the title.

**There is no dirty-close confirmation.** Closing a panel with unsaved edits
discards them silently; the only thing guarded is closing mid-save. If that
should change, it changes in the shell, once.

## Where they legitimately differ

| Panel | Difference, and why |
|---|---|
| Service | No breadcrumbs, and a third branch for "resolved, no service row" — without it the panel falls through to the skeleton and animates forever. Two rows, two mutations, two ledger entries, so the summary and the business model revert separately. |
| Phase | Hints lifted verbatim from the column comments, so the panel and the schema cannot drift. |
| Lane | No evidence, resources or dependency tabs: those all key on a **cell**, and a lane has no link to any of them. The only panel with `PanelEmpty` gating and the fan-out alert. |
| Scenario | A paths accordion opening `multiple`, first path open — comparing two routes is the reason to read this panel, and an accordion that closes one to open the next makes that impossible. |
| Step | The one panel whose save invalidates the canvas grid, because `summary` is also the storyboard caption. |
| Cell | Tabs, two surfaces, an expand toggle, agent commands and the in-slices footer. |

### The lane panel's fan-out

A lane row belongs to one path, so the "same" lane exists once per path. Saving
the lane panel writes **all** of its siblings — the save passes
`lane.siblingLaneIds`, not `lane.id`. The panel says so inline, as an `Alert`
above the fields, and that placement is the rule rather than a preference: this
is a consequence the reader would be surprised by, and something that must be
read is always visible. A hover can be missed by never hovering; an ⓘ can be
missed by never clicking.

Scale check from the delete path: a lane delete addressed by (scenario, name)
removes 93 rows where an older impact function reported 11.

## The cell panel

Two **surfaces** — Details and Differences — are siblings of the whole panel,
switched by one component rendered from two call sites (two verbatim copies
drifted apart once already). The Differences tab carries no count: counts live
in exactly two places app-wide, the menubar Diff count and each ledger group's
trailing number.

Inside Details, **Overview is not a tab.** It always renders inline at the top;
the tab row (Dependencies, Evidence, Resources) sits below it and both share one
scroll area. A new cell always opens on Dependencies, reset during render — and
the arrow editor closes with it, because a half-typed arrow carried onto a
different cell points away from somewhere nobody is looking. The tab body
reserves `min-h-56`, which is cheaper and steadier than easing a panel that
otherwise jumped a couple of hundred pixels per switch.

Three rules the overview follows and new fields should too: the title yields to
the touchpoint when they are identical; the description paragraph is suppressed
when it repeats the title or the content; and the touchpoint is a labelled
field, not a second badge. Printing the same word twice as two facts is the
failure each of them prevents.

**Only outgoing arrows are editable here.** An incoming arrow belongs to the
cell at the other end and is edited from there. Candidates are version-scoped,
because the RPC refuses a cross-version dependency and offering one would only
be a way to reach that refusal.

**Creating a cell writes nothing until Save.** The draft branch opens the panel
on an empty slot's target; ✕, Escape and Cancel discard it entirely. A cancelled
cell never existed — which is the fix for creation feeling broken, back when the
row was written first and filled in later.

**A clicked touchpoint brings its own four fields, under the same Save.** The
panel is showing one cell *and* one of its placements, so `CellPanelEditor`
takes the placement as a prop and its summary, screenshot, link and
role join the form — enclosed and headed with the touchpoint's name,
because two fields called Summary on one screen need a border to say whose is
whose. They sit directly under Text, which is the list that names them, rather
than at the bottom: an author reached this panel by clicking that touchpoint, and
making them scroll past six of the cell's fields to reach it is how an editor
teaches people it is not for them. One Save, for the same reason there is one
Save at all — the editor this replaced had four buttons for one cell and a Save
that only saved half of what was on screen.

**The placement's resources are the one list with its own Save** (#273).
`PlacementResourcesList` sits inside the placement's group: the preview and
the buttons it leads with on top, each with an unset control; every resource
under them in order, with a row menu that sets a preview (an attachment), a
button (a link) or unsets one; a paste field that adds a link named by its
host, nobody typing a name. The list saves on its own button because a reorder
is a whole-list fact written in one transaction, and featuring is one row's
flag the database settles at once — clearing the previous preview in the same
transaction — so folding either into the four-field Save would make that
button write things it cannot show as unsaved.

Two orderings inside that Save are load-bearing. The placement is written
**after** the cell, because saving the cell's text runs
`sync_cell_touchpoints`, and a save that removed this touchpoint's name from
the text deletes its placement along with everything written about it. And the
write is **skipped** when the name is gone, rather than left to fail on zero
rows: the author asked for exactly that, and reporting it as an error about a
missing placement would be the editor blaming them for it.

The placement editor only ever **updates**, and never inserts. Which cells may
hold a placement is decided in one place — `sync_cell_touchpoints`, which
admits only touchpoint-bearing cells — and an editor that could create one
would be a second answer to that question. `placementGateContract.test.ts`
holds it; the grants hold the other half, since `cell_id` and `touchpoint_id`
are not updatable by a client. A fallback board's placements carry no row id,
so the fields do not appear there at all: there would be nothing to save into.

## A definition hangs off a badge, never off a label

`PanelTermLabel` began as the answer to a dozen section headings that named a
concept and said nothing about it. It over-corrected: eleven labels ended up
carrying a definition, and nine of them — `Status`, `Summary`, `Position`,
`Paths`, `Dependencies`, `Resources` — were ordinary English on a form. A
definition on every label teaches a reader that hovering is not worth doing
about eleven times before it teaches anything, and the words that genuinely
needed explaining were what got lost in it.

**Two shapes now, and which one a word gets is decided by the word.**
`PanelTermLabel` is a BADGE, and it carries a definition; `PanelSectionLabel`
is plain text with nothing behind it, deliberately inert. `src/lib/panelTerms.ts`
holds two entries, because a reader cannot guess what a storyboard or a
touchpoint is and can guess the rest.

The badge is what makes the rule checkable rather than tasteful. "Is this word
jargon" is a judgement that drifts on the next term somebody adds;
`scripts/tests/a-definition-hangs-off-a-badge.test.mjs` asks what a definition
is attached to, which does not. Its subject is the raw `DefinitionPopover`, and
it exempts nothing by name: a component that composes caller-supplied children
is a container — it explains whatever it is handed rather than a word it knows —
and both `EntityDefinitionPopover` and `Field` reach that exemption by the same
sentence.

**`Field`'s `hint` is not a definition** and is not governed by this rule. It
tells an author what to type — "an app image path starting with / or an https
link" — which is a fact about the input, not about a word. It shares the
`DefinitionCard` shape today; that the two look alike is known, and #244 left it
alone rather than deleting fifteen pieces of authoring help to tidy a rule.

**One card everywhere.** `PanelTermLabel`, `Field`'s `hint`, `PanelKindBadge`'s
description, `StatusBadge` and the divider rail labels all render
`DefinitionCard`: sections, each an eyebrow above a body, identically set. See
[panel-affordances.md](../../reference/panel-affordances.md) § One definition
card.

`PanelTextareaField` is a bare `<textarea>` with the cell panel's treatment,
deliberately not `input-group` (which the inventory reserves for the composer).
Read-only renders **prose, not a disabled input** — a disabled textarea reads as
a broken input. Its ring is `ring-inset`, and that is load-bearing: the field
lives inside an accordion panel whose `overflow-hidden` drives the height
animation, and an outset ring gets sheared by the clip.

## Getting in

`EntityPropertiesButton` is one ⓘ for every level. On a lane it is revealed on
hover — a lane label already means two different things depending on where it is
drawn — but **revealed is not absent**: it is transparent at rest and always in
the tab order. It stops propagation, because opening a panel is not a selection,
not a navigation and not a pan.

The header affordances carry a two-flag invariant worth stating plainly:
interactivity is the provider's flag **and** the board being in scope. With the
provider flag alone, 176 lane headers and 125 step headers across every mounted
board wear hover, a focus ring and a pointer. Where a header is not interactive
it renders as inert prose, not a disabled button.

## Invariants a well-meaning edit breaks

1. Renaming `data-cell-detail-panel` — twenty external selectors.
2. Giving two panels the same footer id.
3. Rendering the shell unconditionally instead of returning `null` when closed —
   breaks `@starting-style` entry and strands an invisible drawer.
4. Trusting `onOpenChangeComplete(false)` alone.
5. Keying the canvas top-offset on `open` rather than `open || closing` — the
   panel teleports up before sliding out.
6. OR-ing a second boolean into the cell drawer's `open`. `panelState` is the
   single owner of "is it open", full stop.
7. Dropping the posture key on the drawer.
8. Re-deriving a form from the live query instead of the frozen baseline.
9. Renaming `data-panel-editor` to something cell-specific.
10. Changing a panel's field count without its placeholder.
11. An outset focus ring inside the scenario accordion or the lane rail.
12. Setting the kind badge's colour with a raw value or a utility class. The badge
    this replaced tried `backgroundColor: style.lane`, and `style.lane` is a
    role key — the declaration was invalid, the browser dropped it, and the
    badge rendered as plain text from the day it shipped.
13. Adding `PanelEmpty` to edit mode.
14. Saving the lane panel against `lane.id`, or dropping the fan-out alert.
15. Dropping the canvas invalidation from the step save.
16. A second ⓘ beside a term label, a tab or a status badge.
