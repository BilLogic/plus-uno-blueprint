# Dialogs, sheets and forms

## Drawer and sheet postures — owned here

One component, two postures, keyed remount on the flip. The mechanism lives in
the shared shell `src/components/blueprint/panelShell.tsx`; the cell detail
panel is its most-read consumer, not its home. **This doc is the single owner of
the contract** (components and engineering docs link here — the rule sat under
`components.md` for months, which is a composition rule wearing a components
label):

- **Desktop ≥ breakpoint**: a right-pinned floating *card* (not a full sheet) at
  `--width-cell-panel`, expanding to `--width-cell-panel-expanded`;
  `modal={false}` so the canvas stays live; swipe direction `right`. Its motion
  is an inspector's — it expands out of the selection, it does not arrive from
  off-screen (see the block comment in `animations.css`).
- **Mobile < breakpoint**: a bottom sheet, full width, swipe `down`, view-only
  content, with a grab handle — a bottom sheet says how to dismiss itself; the
  desktop inspector has its ✕. It rests on **two snap points, `40svh` and
  `70svh`**, opens on the lower one, and remembers which for the session. It
  sets no height of its own: `!h-auto` is `height: auto !important` and beats
  the `--drawer-content-height: 100dvh` that snap points need.
- The drawer is **keyed on posture** (`key={mobile ? 'mobile' : 'desktop'}`) so
  a resize across the breakpoint remounts clean instead of reinterpreting an
  in-flight swipe against the wrong axis.
- The posture is published as `data-cell-detail-posture`, which is what the
  motion keys off.
- Surface switches inside an open drawer are content swaps at the same tree
  position — never close-reopen.
- **Snap points reach base-ui through `...props`, not through the wrapper.**
  `src/components/ui/drawer.tsx` destructures `snapPoints` alone; `snapPoint`
  and `onSnapPointChange` arrive via `...props`, which is how `PanelDrawerShell`
  passes them.
- **THE PRIMITIVE CAPS THE SHEET AND OUR CLASSES CANNOT LIFT IT.** On the y axis
  the vendored popup carries
  `--drawer-content-max-height: calc(100dvh - 6rem)`, so the element is 96px
  shorter than the viewport no matter what the consumer sets. A snap point of
  `1` therefore asks for a height that cannot render: the drag travels the whole
  way and the sheet stops 96px short. Measured at 812px: 716. Stops must sit
  under that ceiling — `src/lib/panelSheetSnap.ts` holds them and
  `panelSheetSnap.test.ts` asserts the headroom.
- **No full stop, for a second and independent reason.** `MobileAgentSheet`
  records "92svh read as a full-screen takeover", and the mobile shell's model
  is a live canvas under non-modal sheets. A sheet that covers the board stops
  being an inspector.

The agent dock's docked/floating pair is the same one-component-two-postures
precedent — see [agent-session.md](agent-session.md).

## Which channel says a failure

There are two, and the rule is about **whether the control is still on screen**:

- A path that still has its form or dialog up reports **inline**, in an `Alert`
  next to the control that caused it. Every create dialog does this.
- A path whose control is already gone reports through `reportWriteFailure` into
  `WriteFailureNotices` — a cell delete closes its own menu on success, and ⌘Z
  has no control at all. Both used to reach the console and stop there, which
  reads exactly like success: the spinner clears, the cell is still there, and
  nothing is said.

`WriteFailureNotices` is mounted **outside** `EditorErrorBoundary` in `App.tsx`,
deliberately: a write can fail as the shell falls over, and the notice is what
says so. It is bottom-centre, dismissed by hand rather than timed out — a write
that silently failed is not a thing to take away while the user is still looking
for what happened — and `aria-live="assertive"`, because it is the correction of
a belief the user already holds. At most three stack; a report that grows
without limit buries the canvas under the report of its own trouble.

## The create dialogs

Each asks for the decisions that cannot be made later, and no more.

**`CreatePhaseDialog`** appends a phase and asks only for a name. **No position
picker**: a phase is a column of the whole canvas, so inserting one mid-sequence
re-lays-out every scenario to its right — that is a reorder, with its own
consequences. Appending is always safe. It does not ask for a summary either;
demanding one up front is how placeholder text ends up in a blueprint.

**`CreateBlueprintDialog`** creates a scenario: where it lives, what it is
called, which lanes it starts with, how many columns. Columns are created empty
and named `Step 1…n` — naming them here would be five text fields answering a
question nobody can answer before they have seen the grid. **The lane set is the
decision worth making up front**, because lanes are what a scenario is compared
along, and lane sources are read from existing scenarios rather than typed: the
whole point of copying is to land on the vocabulary that already exists. When
the dialog is opened from a phase row the phase becomes a label, not a picker —
asking again invites answering differently from the row that was clicked.

**`CreateVersionDialog`** covers blank and copy in one dialog, because the
choice between them is the same decision and splitting it into "New" and
"Duplicate" makes people pick before they know. Its outcome sentence is not
decoration: copying arrows is the part people get wrong, and "with the arrows
repointed onto the copies" is the only way to say the copy will not draw lines
back into the original.

Shared idioms worth copying: clear the error on close; gate on busy and ready;
validate through a `lib/*Validation` module that returns a `problems` list; and
call `invalidateStructure()` after every structural create, because cascades
cannot be mirrored client-side.

## `DeleteStructureDialog` — confirm by naming what is destroyed

**This is the only confirmation UI for deleting anything structural, slices
included.** A second, lighter dialog for one kind is how a product teaches that
some deletes are casual, and none of these are.

The impact is **read before the dialog can be confirmed, never estimated in the
client**. A step delete cascades to every cell in that step across every path,
and then to the arrows on both ends of each; a dialog that counted what it could
see would undercount by design. Nothing may be confirmed before that read
lands — the numbers are the whole reason to ask.

What it shows comes from one `ImpactSummary`:

- **facts** — count-plus-noun tiles, set apart from prose. The number *is* the
  consequence; buried mid-sentence it reads as decoration, which is how a
  confirm dialog ends up being clicked through.
- **warnings** and **reassurances** — relayed **verbatim**. Every sentence is
  composed in `src/lib/deletionSafety.ts`; the dialog re-words nothing.
  Rewording them is how the "nothing is destroyed" over-promise returns on a
  second surface.

That over-promise is worth understanding before touching this copy. "Nothing is
destroyed without a copy behind it" printed directly under "these slices cannot
be restored by undo" is a dialog contradicting itself in adjacent lines, and the
sentence people believe is the reassuring one. So the reassurance is
**qualified, not merely softened**, when unrecoverable slice frames are in
scope: the blueprint rows come back, the frames pointing at them do not. Note
also that *no* recovery keys at all counts as unrecoverable, not as nothing to
worry about — which is exactly what a plain `.some()` on an empty array gets
wrong.

Typing the name is the gate, matched exact-after-trim and **case-sensitively**:
a case-insensitive match would let `happy path` delete `Happy Path`, which is
most of the way to not asking. Two error kinds get two recoveries — a failed
*read* replaces Delete with `Try again` (a disabled Delete there is a dead end,
and the failure was the read), a failed *write* keeps the gate open. And session
state resets **in render**, because opening the dialog on a second target must
not paint one frame carrying the first target's counts.

Slices are the asymmetry: they have no archive, the copy says so, and a slice
must never become a structural deletion kind. The impact read itself
(`readDeletionImpact`) is shared with the agent's `measure_deletion_impact`, so
the numbers the agent quotes and the numbers the dialog shows cannot drift.
Where no archive exists the delete affordance is **hidden, not disabled** — a
disabled delete invites someone to go looking for how to enable it, and there is
no safe way to.

## `SessionChangesSheet` — review, then commit

What has changed since Edit was turned on, and the way to keep it. It appears
only once something has changed: a permanent Save on a canvas that has already
saved everything is a control that lies at rest.

**It replaces undo and redo rather than joining them. Undo is positional; this
is addressable.** Having added a step, a lane and a cell, wanting the lane back
should not mean undoing two things you meant to keep.

- **Save is not a write.** Those writes already landed; Save is the moment the
  way back closes. The header says "Already saved — Save just clears the list."
  A session containing deletes arms a confirm first.
- **One control, not two.** The flag counter and the Save button used to sit
  side by side — the same fact wearing two faces. `Save changes` *is* the
  trigger that opens the list, so **saving requires seeing what is being kept**.
- **Per-row revert**, plus a crosshair that flies to the cell. Agent-authored
  rows carry ✦ and nothing else differs — same revert, same Save gate; the badge
  is the entire distinction.
- **Revert all** runs sequentially, newest first, through the same inverse the
  row and ⌘Z use — these inverses are ordered, so a cell added into a lane added
  in the same session has to go first. Entries with no captured inverse (a slice
  delete has no archive) are **not reverted and not dropped**: they stay in the
  list and are named underneath it, with the reason travelling along, because
  "had no inverse" and "had one and it threw" are different facts about what to
  do next.
- The list is re-read from the store on every iteration rather than captured
  once. Reverting two edits to one cell from a stale snapshot writes an
  intermediate value nobody chose, with an empty ledger and no way back.

Three triggers can start a revert — the row button, Revert all, and ⌘Z — and
they share **one** in-flight gate. They did not always: the per-entry set could
not answer "is anything reverting?", so ⌘Z was right by accident while the row
button asked only its own local flag and walked straight through the middle of a
run. Related: `'already-in-flight'` is not success — the entry was neither
reverted nor removed, and a caller reading it as done leaves the user believing
a change was taken back that is still there.

⌘Z is scoped away from text fields (inside an input, the browser's own undo is
the one people mean) and skips entries with no inverse rather than silently
doing nothing forever.

## `CreateSliceSheet`

A sheet hanging off its button, **not a modal**. The picked cells are the
subject, and a scrim dims the one thing you need to look at while deciding
whether the selection is right — so the canvas stays lit and the sheet sits
beside it. **Closing it does not clear the picks; the selection outlives the
sheet.**

Two steps, because they are two different jobs: shaping the screens is done
against the canvas, naming is done afterwards, once you know what you have made.
Asking for a title first asks for it at the moment you are least able to give
it. There is no type picker and no quick-group preset — the type is read off the
selection, and grouping is a drag.

A live selection change **merges** into the composed screens rather than
reseeding them. Reseeding on any change used to throw away minutes of
drag-composed grouping for one stray pick.

## Field primitives

**`OwnerTagSelect` is the pattern.** Owner as a tag, not free text — free text
is how a blueprint ends up with `Tutor Ops`, `TutorOps` and `tutor ops` as three
different teams. The anatomy is worth copying wholesale: trigger showing value
or placeholder → autofocused "Find or create…" filter → matching rows with a
check on the current value → an explicit `Create "x"` row (one visible row, not
a silent save) → a Clear row when a value is set. Enter picks the exact match or
creates; never a silent no-op.

Its rename is the interesting part: the pencil renames a tag **everywhere it is
used**, owner and perceived owner both, because a tag is one fact about the
organisation rather than a per-cell string. It refuses renaming *onto* an
existing tag — that would silently merge two vocabularies, and the recorded
revert would then rename every cell of the target tag back, corrupting cells
that were never touched.

The relatives differ on purpose:

| Primitive | Shape | Why not `OwnerTagSelect` |
|---|---|---|
| `StakeholderSelect` | same geometry, **read-only over the registry** | creating or renaming a stakeholder is an agent tool with a ledger entry, not something to do by typing into a lane. "Nobody" is a first-class choice, not an empty state. |
| `StatusSelect` | a native `<select>` | six fixed options, no search, no multi-select — and it gets keyboard and touch for free. Options carry the full label, because a dropdown is where a reader learns what the six words mean. |
| `PathMultiSelect` | a multi-select **filter**, five layouts | not a picker at all. Its `id` is a filter key (`type:name`), never a uuid — anything that writes to a path row wants `pathIds`. |
| `WalkthroughPathSelect` | a radio menu | degenerates to a static badge when there is one path. Shares its label formatter with `PathMultiSelect`. |

**`StatusBadge`** renders **every** status, `live` included. It was hidden at
first on the argument that the default covers most of the board — but that only
holds in a dense list; in a properties block, a labelled field with no value
reads as broken. Three treatments: `live` quiet and solid; the unbuilt three
muted and **dashed**, echoing the dashed border those cells already carry on the
canvas, so there is one vocabulary for "this does not exist yet" in the panel
and on the board; `at_risk` and `deprecated` in warning tint, the one case worth
a colour. The definition hovers off the word itself — no ⓘ.

The vocabulary is `src/lib/entityStatus.ts`, and its history is the argument
against inventing a second one. It began as two values on cells, `planned` and
`prototype`, and the boundary did not order: the one case labelled `planned` was
a card already merged and sitting in QA. It was renamed off `maturity` because
that word promised a ladder — three rungs below shipped, two qualifying it, and
shipped itself unrepresented, so `deprecated` was not "further along" than
`at_risk`. `live` removes the double duty NULL was doing across 879 cells: "how
it works today" and "nobody has assessed this" at once. Paths share the
vocabulary deliberately; a second vocabulary for the same question drifts from
the first within a month.
