# Slice view

A slice is a saved cut of the board for one audience — a view, not a copy. On
screen it is **the normal blueprint**, with membership applied on top: same
zoom/pan canvas, same cell panel, opened on the slice's scenario, with
non-members dimmed and members ringed and numbered.

Three postures: the **focus tab** (the live canvas with the membership overlay),
**presentation** (a dark full-bleed stage, its own tab, or full-bleed on mobile),
and **slide mode**, which is a sidebar surface rather than a slice concept at
all.

Design mode **is** edit mode here — the tab *is* the editor, so the frame strip
and the picker mount at the surface rather than behind a separate Edit button.
Two overlapping "clicks mean something else" states was one too many.

## The dim

The slice dim is CSS, not React, driven by one container attribute and one
per-cell attribute:

- **Members** keep a role-accent ring and a soft shadow lift, and they keep it
  whether or not the dim is up. The ring takes the lane's accent so members pop
  at overview zoom.
- **Non-members** go to `opacity: 0.6` with `saturate(0.3) grayscale(0.55)`.

The opacity number is the interesting part, because it used to be 0.22.
Opacity composites the cell's black text against the canvas along with its fill,
so at 0.22 the text measured **1.61:1** against its own cell. Measured across
the lane fills: 0.45 gives ~3.0:1, 0.55 ~4.2:1, 0.6 ~5.0:1. **The desaturate
does the de-emphasis work the opacity used to overreach for.** If you are
tempted to push the dim further, push the saturation, not the alpha.

There is no scrim plane — per-cell dim, desaturate and grey — because the slice
tab wraps the normal blueprint view and the grid keeps its own stacking
contexts.

### What the filter costs, measured

A per-cell `filter` makes every non-member cell its own render surface, which
re-rasterizes when the camera scale changes. Measured 2026-08-26 rather than
guessed: a 240-frame scripted zoom-and-pan sweep across the 0.08–0.26 band —
the band that puts the most cells on screen at once — run against the In-session
phase canvas (338 cells) with the shipped declaration applied to the first N of
them and to none. Chromium, 880×700 viewport, dev build, three interleaved
repetitions:

| cells carrying the filter | mean frame | p95 | frames over 16.7 ms (of 238) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 11.3 ms | 17.6 ms | 22 |
| 37 | 11.1 ms | 18.0 ms | 19 |
| 56 | 11.1 ms | 17.9 ms | 24 |
| 112 | 11.2 ms | 17.2 ms | 20 |
| 169 | 12.0 ms | 25.0 ms | 29 |
| 225 | 11.8 ms | 24.8 ms | 30 |
| 281 | 13.6 ms | 26.3 ms | 53 |
| 338 | 14.4 ms | 33.4 ms | 61 |

Flat to ~112, first moves at ~170, and by ~280 it has roughly doubled the
dropped-frame count. The production build reproduces both ends (0 → 12.4 ms
mean / 18.1 ms p95; 338 → 15.9 ms / 33.4 ms), so this is raster, not dev-server
overhead. The `opacity` costs nothing at any count measured — the whole bill is
the filter.

**Slice focus never gets near the knee.** A v1 slice is single-scenario
(`useSliceScenarioId`), so the dim only ever covers one board: 31 of 37 cells on
the dev fallback slice, ~56 on the Ecoeled board this was filed against. Both
sit in the flat stretch, where the sweep cannot tell the filter from no filter.
Coverage bounds it a second way — non-member cells never painted more than ~16%
of the viewport at any zoom, because cards have gaps and zooming in takes cells
off screen as fast as it grows them.

So the look stays and there is nothing to trade. The number to keep is the
headroom: about 3× in cell count, spent only if slices ever go multi-scenario.
Re-measure then, and re-measure for a phone — this was a desktop Chromium, and
the knee moves with the device.

A separate draft state, `data-slice-picked`, uses the **primary** accent rather
than the member ring, deliberately: while picking, "in this draft" and "in some
saved slice" are different states that can both be true on the same cell.

**Editing lifts the dim entirely** — you cannot pick a cell you cannot see.
Clicking a member re-focuses, clicking elsewhere lifts the dim, and chrome (the
cell panel, the navbar, canvas nav, the zoom indicator, the annotation toolbar,
the walkthrough modal) is neutral. A drag past 5px is a pan, not a click. While
de-focused a floating "Showing all · Back to slice" pill appears, and it counts
as chrome so clicking it does not re-trigger the rule.

## Presentation, and why the semantic layer re-derives per scope

The presentation stage carries `.dark` **regardless of the app theme**, and the
slice header band rides at the top of it in dark tokens with Return where the
focus tab shows Present — presentation is a mode of the slice, not a separate
screen. Frames render synchronously from the cached slice data; navigation never
refetches. Keyboard is scoped to the container, not to `window`.

That subtree `.dark` is the reason for one of the design system's more surprising
rules, and it is worth knowing here because this surface is the only thing that
forces it: **every semantic derivation is re-declared at each scope that can
override a dial** (`:root, .dark, .light`). Custom properties resolve their
`var()`s at computed-value time, which happens *before* inheritance — so a
descendant that re-declares a dial cannot retroactively re-derive anything
declared only at `:root`. `.light` is in the list for the same reason: it lets a
subtree force light inside a dark ancestor. See
[foundations/color.md](../foundations/color.md).

`SliceHeaderBand` is one component in two modes, so switching between them reads
as a mode change on one object rather than two unrelated screens. Every colour
is a token, so it picks up dark tokens for free inside the stage. When the
sidebar is collapsed the band renders nothing and hands its identity and primary
action to the floating pill.

## Two editing surfaces, split by what they are good at

Clicking a cell on the canvas adds it to the **active frame**, or removes it from
wherever it is. That single rule is what makes the two surfaces one editor
rather than two: **the strip says where new cells land, the canvas says which
cells.**

**Drag lives in the strip, never on the artboard.** The canvas is a pan/zoom
surface, and a drag that starts on a cell is already the camera's gesture. So
the canvas adds and removes by clicking, and the strip decides grouping and
order. Inside the strip there are two deliberately distinct drag targets: a cell
chip moves between frames, a frame header reorders frames. Drop position is read
from the pointer's Y against the chip's midpoint — top half inserts before,
bottom half after — and shown as a 2px primary rule above or below the chip.
(Those two indicators are the file's arbitrary `shadow-[…]` literals; they are
hairline rules, not shadows, and there is no token for a directional insertion
bar. See [foundations/elevation.md](../foundations/elevation.md).)

Chip labels use the cell's described label, not its id: `070110` is an address,
and nobody recognises their content by address.

`SliceScreenComposer` does ordering **and** grouping in one list. Presets were
the wrong idea — grouping is something people shape cell by cell, and since they
are already dragging to reorder, both belong in one gesture space. Cells between
two dividers are one screen, so reordering and re-bucketing are the same drag.

Its drag is **pointer events, not HTML5 drag-and-drop**, and the reason is worth
carrying to the next drag surface: that API failed here twice — first silently
refusing to start without a `dataTransfer` payload, then fighting the popover for
the pointer — and its failures all present the same way, the row snapping back
and the user being told, in effect, that they imagined the gesture. Pointer
capture has one owner and no such moods.

"Screen" is the word in the composer on purpose: a **frame** is the row in
`slice_items`, a **screen** is what the reader sees in presentation. The code
keeps `frame`.

## The storyboard field

Offered only on a **saved** frame, because the image is stored at a path derived
from the frame's row id — an unsaved frame has no id, and inventing one leaves a
file nothing ever points at.

The file is checked before it is sent, size before mime, against a 5 MiB cap
that matches the bucket's own limit. Upload is an upsert onto the derived path,
so replacing an image overwrites it, and the `updated_at` stamp written
alongside is what busts the CDN cache.

## Slide mode and the rest

- **`SlideNav`'s expansion state lives in `EditorContext`, not locally.** Local
  state died on every mode switch, skeleton swap and presentation tab, since all
  of those unmount the sidebar. It is also deliberately never derived from
  selection — that is what makes collapsing a phase leave the camera alone.
- Slide mode's sidebar `+` affordances belong to Edit mode; in View the sidebar
  navigates and nothing more.
- `SlideStickyHeader` composes the phase menubar header, the compare controls and
  the path selector; its description falls back to the selected path's summary.
- `ScenarioSlideFilters` is a path-filter wrapper that stops pointer and click
  propagation so canvas gestures do not fire underneath it.
- **Loading is one vocabulary for the whole chain.** One label, one skeleton hold
  key for slice → scenario → blueprint, and the header band stays a skeleton
  through stage two: the band is canvas furniture like the toolbar — it waits,
  and both arrive on the beat the board opens its first lane.
