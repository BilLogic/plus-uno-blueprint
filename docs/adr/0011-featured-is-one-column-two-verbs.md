summary: A resource's `featured` flag is one boolean whose meaning depends on the resource's kind — a featured attachment is the owner's preview, a featured link is one of its buttons — rather than two columns or a role enum, because the two verbs are what a reader sees and the one column is what an author decides.

# Featured is one column, two verbs

A placement, or a cell, can point at any number of resources (#271). What it
LEADS with — the picture the panel opens on, the buttons under it — is
decided by one boolean on the resource row, `featured`, and read through the
resource's `kind`:

- a featured **attachment** is the owner's **preview**: at most one per
  owner, held by a partial unique index;
- a featured **link** is one of the owner's **buttons**, named by its host:
  any number.

The panel says "Set as preview" over an attachment and "Set as button" over a
link (#273); the column underneath says `featured = true` for both.

## Why one column and not two, or an enum

The obvious alternatives were `preview_id` on the owner and `is_button` on
the link, or a `role in ('preview', 'button', 'none')` on the resource. Both
encode on the row a fact that is already there: an attachment cannot be a
button and a link cannot be a preview, so the second word is always
determined by `kind`. A role enum would admit the two contradictory rows
(`kind = 'link', role = 'preview'`) that the split forbids by construction,
and a pointer on the owner would need a second write to stay in step with the
row it points at — the shape that made the placement's old `screenshot` and
`url` columns drift from the resources copied out of them (#276).

The author's decision is one bit: *lead with this*. The reader sees two
verbs because the two kinds are shown two ways. Keeping the bit on the row
means "unset" is the same write whichever verb it undoes, the inverse is
`restore_featured_resources` over `{id, featured}` pairs whatever the kind,
and a resource carries everything about itself.

## Consequences

- The "one preview per owner" rule is a partial unique index over
  `(cell_touchpoint_id) where featured and kind = 'attachment'` and its
  cell-owned twin, not a foreign key. Featuring a second attachment first
  clears the first in the same transaction (`set_featured_resource`); a
  restore writes `false` rows before `true` rows for the same reason.
- A reader who wants "the preview" reads `featured and kind = 'attachment'`,
  never `featured` alone. `featuredPresentation` is where the app does this
  once.
- The plausible "fix" — adding `role` so the verb is stored — would store a
  second copy of `kind`. If a third kind ever needs a third verb, it gets
  one in the presentation layer, and the column stays a bit.
